# Agent Training Context - FreightRoll/YardFlow

## 🎓 Required Reading for All Agents

This document provides essential context for AI agents working on FreightRoll/YardFlow website, marketing, and sales materials. All content must align with these principles.

---

## 🧠 Core Mental Models

### 1. The Driver-in-Truck Principle
**Everything** we build aims to keep the driver in the truck. Period.

- **Current state**: Drivers exit truck 2-4 times per visit (5-15 min added time)
- **Our goal**: Zero exits from arrival to departure
- **How**: Digital check-in, in-cab instructions, e-paperwork, automated gates

**Content Test**: Does this feature/message reinforce that the driver stays in the truck? If no, reconsider.

### 2. The 100% Automation Promise
We don't sell "98% automation + manual exceptions." We solve **all** the workflows.

**Why competitors fail**: They optimize for easy scenarios (closed fleets, simple facilities) and kick edge cases back to operations teams.

**Why we win**: 7 years figuring out:
- Flip phone users
- Reefer temperature variance
- Seal checks without cameras
- Short driveways vs. long driveways
- Mixed inbound carriers

**Content Test**: Are we positioning as "handles everything" or "reduces most work"? Former only.

### 3. The Paper ROI Anchor
> "It pays for itself with paper. Everything else is upside."

This is the **only** ROI pitch that's always underwritable:
- 2-page BOL × $0.10/page = $0.20/shipment savings
- Finance can approve based on paper alone
- All other benefits (speed, visibility, detention tracking) are bonus

**Content Test**: Can a CFO approve this purchase based on paper savings alone? If yes, proceed. If "maybe," revise.

## 📐 Positioning Framework

### Who We Are
- **Standard protocol solution** for yard automation
- **Network effect play**: More facilities = stronger protocol
- **100% workflow coverage**: No facility type is "too complex"

### Who We're NOT
- Custom solution builders (we're the standard)
- Closed-fleet-only vendors (Outpost)
- 98% automation vendors who create new operational burdens

### Market Gaps We Fill
Most logistics companies don't know:
1. Standard protocol solution exists
2. 100% automation is achievable (not 98% + exceptions)
3. Their yard inefficiency costs ($0.20/shipment adds up fast)
4. Solutions exist for "their unique situation" (reefer, mixed carrier, etc.)

**Content Test**: Does this message educate on existence + capability? If just capability, add context.

## 💰 Pricing & Packaging Strategy

### Model Structure

| Tier | What's Included | Pricing Logic | ROI Anchor |
|------|----------------|---------------|------------|
| **Core** | Digital modules (gate, dock, paperless BOL) | $0.10-0.20/shipment | Paper savings |
| **Enhanced** | Core + Gen Logs machine vision (white-labeled) | +$40k/facility/year | Headcount reduction potential |
| **Future Add-ons** | RTLS (real-time location) | TBD (economics being modeled) | Yard check automation |

### Pricing Display Rules
**DO NOT** put pricing publicly on website (it's a moving target).

**DO** create email-gated calculator:
1. Capture: Name, Business Email, # Facilities, Avg Turn Time, Facility Type
2. Whitelist: Filter @gmail/@yahoo (need business email)
3. Output: Scenario-specific pricing estimate
4. CRM trigger: High-value leads auto-notify sales

**Content Test**: Is pricing discoverable but gated? Can we capture qualification data? If no to either, revise.

---

## 🎯 Sales Scenario Differentiation

### RFQ/Inbound (UFP-type)
**They already know**:
- Problem exists
- ROI is good
- They need a solution

**Our job**:
- Best product
- Meet most requirements
- Competitive pricing
- Smooth buying process

**Content approach**: Feature/benefit focused, competitive differentiation, ease of implementation.

---

### Outbound/Consultative (Cold market)
**They don't know**:
- Problem is solvable
- Standard protocol exists
- Their "unique" situation has been solved

**Our job**:
- Educate on problem cost
- Simplify ROI ("pays for itself with paper")
- Build confidence ("we've thought about your facility type")
- Remove risk perception

**Content approach**: Problem-aware messaging, use case scenarios, ROI calculators, confidence-building proof.

---

## 🏭 Facility Type Use Cases

### Use Case Matrix

| Facility Type | Key Challenge | Our Solution | Content Hook |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Long Driveway** | Pre-staging space available | QR code pull-over zones | "Use your driveway as your check-in lane" |
| **Short Driveway** | Gate backup risk | Super-fast reference # flow | "Through the gate in under 30 seconds" |
| **Reefer-Heavy** | Temp/fuel/seal verification | Driver upload + guard digitization | "Automate documentation, not just gates" |
| **Mixed Carrier** | Unknown drivers until arrival | Fast unknown-driver flows | "No pre-registration required" |
| **High Security** | Seal checks, loaded trailer verification | Photo capture + manual backup | "Compliance without slowdowns" |

**Content Test**: Does this use case align with one of these facility types? If describing "all facilities," get more specific.

---

## 🚫 Forbidden Messaging

### NEVER Say:
- "Eliminate all headcount" (only true for some facilities)
- "98% automation" (implies we create exceptions)
- "Custom solution" (we're the standard protocol)
- "Only for large enterprises" (SMBs can use core tier)
- "Requires IoT trailers" (we handle non-sensor scenarios)

### ALWAYS Say:
- "Keep driver in truck"
- "Pays for itself with paper"
- "100% workflow coverage"
- "Standard protocol solution"
- "No exceptions kicked back to your team"

**Content Test**: Scan for forbidden phrases. Replace with always-say equivalents.

---

## 🎨 Brand Voice Guidelines

### Jake's Language Patterns
CEO uses specific phrases repeatedly - these are **brand voice**:

✅ **Use verbatim**:
- "Keep the driver in the truck"
- "Pays for itself with paper"
- "Standard protocol solution"
- "Yard network standard protocol system"  
- "We solve for 100% of the problem"
- "We don't kick any s*** back to you" (clean version: "No exceptions returned to your ops team")

### Tone Attributes
- **Confident, not arrogant**: We've solved this. Not "we think we can."
- **Specific, not vague**: "5-15 minutes per trip" not "saves time"
- **Pragmatic, not utopian**: Guards still needed at some facilities - we digitize their work
- **ROI-first, not feature-first**: Paper savings → then bells and whistles

**Content Test**: Does this sound like a 7-year veteran explaining something they've fully figured out? If tentative, revise.

---

## 🔧 Technical Complexity Principles

### When to Simplify
- **Homepage**: High-level benefits only
- **Industry pages**: One use case, deeply explained
- **Pricing pages**: ROI calculator, not feature lists
- **Case studies**: Customer's problem → our solution → their results

### When to Get Technical
- **RFQ responses**: Full feature matrix
- **Sales calls**: Workflow diagrams, edge case handling
- **Integration docs**: API specs, data models
- **Product pages**: Feature deep-dives with technical FAQs

**Content Test**: Is the audience ready for this level of detail at this stage? If early-stage prospect, simplify.

---

## 📊 Competitive Differentiation

### Outpost (Primary Competitor)
**Their strength**: Simple gate automation for closed fleets  
**Their weakness**: Can't handle diverse inbound, reefer complexity, edge cases

**Our strength**: Works for Lineage, Primo, UFP (diverse carriers, complex operations)  
**Our messaging**: "Built for the hard problems, not just the easy ones"

### Generic Yard Management Systems
**Their approach**: Software-only, manual process digitization  
**Their weakness**: Still requires humans at gates, docks, yard checks

**Our approach**: Hardware + software + workflow design  
**Our messaging**: "Automation, not just digitization"

**Content Test**: Does this position us as handling harder problems than competitors? If not, revise.

---

## 🌐 Website Content Strategy

### Homepage
- **Hero**: "Keep drivers in trucks. Automate yard operations. Pay for it with paper savings."
- **Value Props**: Speed (5-15 min saved), Cost (paper ROI), Completeness (100% workflows)
- **CTA**: "Calculate Your ROI" (email-gated calculator)

### Solutions Pages
Create facility-type specific pages:
- `/solutions/reefer-facilities`
- `/solutions/mixed-carrier-yards`
- `/solutions/high-security-operations`

Each follows: **Their Challenge → Our Approach → Workflow Visual → ROI Impact → CTA**

### Pricing Page
- **NOT**: Public price list
- **YES**: Email-gated calculator with scenario inputs
- **Copy**: "Your pricing depends on facility count, shipment volume, and configuration. Get a custom estimate in 60 seconds."

### Case Studies (Needed)
- **Primo**: Paper ROI + visibility gains
- **Lineage**: Guard digitization (not elimination)
- **UFP**: RFQ win story (when available)

**Content Test**: Does each page have a specific job (educate, qualify, convert, retain)? Multi-purpose pages fail.

---

## 🎥 Content Repurposing Strategy

### Source Material
- Jake's weekly calls (need Firefly video enabled)
- Customer RFQ responses
- Internal strategy decks
- Product roadmap discussions

### Output Formats
1. **Social posts**: Jake quote + visual + link
2. **Blog articles**: Deep-dive on workflow type
3. **Video clips**: 60-90 sec clips for LinkedIn
4. **Email sequences**: Drip campaign for gated content
5. **Sales enablement**: One-pagers per use case

**Content Test**: Can this be atomized into 5+ pieces of content? If single-use only, reconsider effort.

---

## 📈 Metrics That Matter

### Website
- Email captures (pricing calculator)
- Time on solutions pages
- Deck downloads (gated)
- Demo requests

### Sales
- RFQ response rate
- Close rate (consultative vs. RFQ)
- Average deal size
- Time to close

### Product
- Driver check-in speed (under 30 sec?)
- Exception rate (sub-2%?)
- Paper cost savings (validated?)
- Guard time savings (measurable?)

**Content Test**: Does this content move one of these metrics? If unclear impact, it's nice-to-have.

---

## 🚀 Campaign Playbooks

### Manifest (Early 2026)
- **Goal**: RFQ pipeline generation
- **Audience**: Logistics ops leaders, facility managers
- **Content**: Reefer workflow video, ROI calculator, UFP case study (if approved)
- **CTA**: "Schedule a yard workflow audit"

### Modex (Post-Manifest)
- **Goal**: Brand awareness + partnership pipeline
- **Audience**: Technology partners, enterprise prospects
- **Content**: Standard protocol messaging, network effect story
- **CTA**: "Join the yard automation network"

**Content Test**: Does this align with campaign goal and audience needs? If generic, specify.

---

## 🤝 Partnership Messaging

### Gen Logs (Machine Vision)
- **Public**: "Industry-leading machine vision" (white-labeled, not branded)
- **Internal**: Cost component of enhanced tier (~$40k/facility value)
- **Opportunity**: Co-marketing on RTLS future module

### Twilio (SMS)
- **Public**: Not mentioned (just "driver notifications")
- **Internal**: COGS component, baked into pricing

**Content Test**: Are we white-labeling correctly? Partner brands should be invisible in customer-facing content.

## 📋 Content Creation Checklist

Before publishing ANY content, verify:

- [ ] Reinforces "driver stays in truck" principle
- [ ] Positions as 100% solution (not 98%)
- [ ] Anchors ROI to paper savings (underwritable)
- [ ] Addresses specific facility type or use case
- [ ] Uses Jake's language patterns
- [ ] Avoids forbidden messaging
- [ ] Differentiates from Outpost/competitors
- [ ] Has clear CTA tied to metric
- [ ] Can be repurposed into 3+ formats

## 🎓 Continuous Learning

### Required Updates
As new information emerges:
1. Update this doc (version control in git)
2. Notify all active agents
3. Audit existing content for conflicts
4. Update templates/guidelines

### Feedback Loop
After each:
- RFQ win/loss
- Customer onboarding
- Sales call recording
- Product launch

**Extract**: New use cases, objection patterns, ROI data, competitor moves

**Content Test**: Is this insight captured somewhere accessible? If in someone's head only, document it.

---

## 📞 Escalation Paths

### When Unsure
- **Product questions**: Reference Jake's calls or UFP deck
- **Pricing questions**: Don't guess - mark for CEO review
- **Competitive claims**: Verify before publishing
- **ROI calculations**: Use paper anchor (20¢/shipment) only

### Red Flags
- Customer asks for public pricing → Route to email-gated calculator
- Prospect says "just like Outpost" → Differentiate immediately
- ROI seems too good to be true → Verify math with CEO
- Edge case we haven't seen → Document, escalate to product team

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

An agent working on FreightRoll content is successful when:

1. **CEO Approval**: Jake says "Yes, that's exactly right"
2. **Customer Resonance**: Prospects say "You get our problem"
3. **Sales Velocity**: Content shortens sales cycles
4. **Metric Movement**: Email captures, demos, RFQs increase
5. **Consistency**: All content sounds like same confident, specific voice

**If any of these is failing, refer back to this doc and course-correct.**
