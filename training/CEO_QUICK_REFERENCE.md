# CEO Quick Reference - Jake's Core Principles
*Extracted from Jan 22, 2026 Weekly Call*

## 🎯 The Core Mission
**Keep the driver in the truck throughout the entire yard process**

Currently drivers exit truck 2-4 times:
- Gate entry
- Shipping/receiving check-in
- Shipping/receiving check-out
- Gate exit

**Cost**: 5-15 minutes added per trip

## 💡 Positioning & Messaging

### The One-Liner
> "It pays for itself with paper. Everything else is upside."

### The Standard Protocol Promise
- **Not 98% automation** (that kicks 2% exceptions back to customer)
- **100% problem solving** (figure out all workflows, handle all edge cases)
- **Confidence assumption**: "There's a whole bunch of other people that will get it" - no desperation, just value

### Market Education Gap
Most prospects don't know:
1. A standard protocol solution exists
2. How much the problem is costing them
3. That 100% automation is achievable (not 98% + manual exceptions)

**Website Job**: Make them aware we've already thought about their specific scenario

## 📊 Pricing Philosophy

### Core Model
- **Anchor**: 10¢/page paper savings
- **Typical BOL**: 2 pages
- **Per-shipment cost**: 20¢
- **Underwritable**: Finance can approve based on paper alone

### Enhanced Model
- Core features +
- Gen Logs machine vision (white-labeled)
- ~$40k/facility annual value

### Future Add-Ons
- **RTLS**: Separate module (economics TBD)
  - Concern: 160 facilities × 6 yard checks/day × $0.10 = $16k/day = $5.8M/year potential cost
  - Needs separate pricing model

## 🏭 Facility Workflow Variations

### Long Driveway Facilities
- Pre-staging parking available
- QR codes along entry path
- Driver can pull over, check in, then proceed to gate

### Short Driveway Facilities  
- Backup-sensitive
- Super-fast gate flow required
- Enter reference # + phone → pass through → complete check-in after gate

### Reefer Facilities (Lineage)
- **Additional data needed**: Temperature, set point, fuel level
- **Challenge**: Every reefer unit has different display interface
- **Reality**: Can't eliminate guard (sensor coverage gaps, driver trust issues)
- **Solution**: Enable guard to document digitally (photos, chain of info)

### Loaded Trailers
- **Seal check**: Present? Number match?
- **Tug check**: Physical tampering verification
- **Edge case handling**: Flip phone users can't take photos → kiosk phone attachment? Manual backup process?

## 🎯 Sales Strategy Differences

### RFQ Scenario (UFP-type)
- Customer already knows problem exists
- Customer already calculated ROI
- **Our job**: Best product + meet most requirements + competitive price
- **Don't need to**: Educate on problem or justify ROI

### Consultative Sales
- Customer doesn't know problem exists OR
- Customer knows but thinks they can't solve it OR  
- Customer doesn't know standard protocol solution exists
- **Our job**: Make ROI dead simple ("pays for itself with paper")
- **Don't need to**: Over-explain technical details upfront

## 🚫 What NOT to Say

### Avoid
- "We eliminate headcount" (only works for closed fleets like Warner)
- "98% automation" (implies 2% manual exception handling)
- "Custom solution" (we're the standard protocol)
- Public pricing (it's a moving target, gate it behind email capture)

### Instead Say
- "Keeps driver in truck" (tangible time savings)
- "100% workflow coverage" (no exceptions kicked back)
- "Standard protocol solution" (not custom, but handles all scenarios)
- "Pays for itself with paper" (underwritable ROI)

## 🔧 Technical Realities

### Edge Cases We Solve
1. **Flip phone drivers**: Manual backup flows, kiosk phones
2. **No pre-check-in**: Fast gate flows for unknown-until-arrival drivers
3. **Reefer variability**: Button-pushing required for temp/fuel data (can't be passive camera)
4. **Seal verification**: Photo capture + manual tug check still needed
5. **Sensor gaps**: Not all trailers have IoT, drivers can lie → guards still needed at some facilities

### Partnerships
- **Gen Logs**: Machine vision, white-labeled in enhanced package
- **Twilio**: SMS (COGS component, absorbed in pricing)

## 📈 ROI Components

### Hard Costs (Underwritable)
- Paper/printing savings: $0.20/shipment baseline
- Gate automation: $0.10/shipment
- Headcount reduction: *Sometimes* (not always achievable)

### Soft Benefits (Value Add)
- Faster truck turn times
- Better yard visibility
- Detention tracking
- Improved dock-to-door visibility
- Reduced paperwork errors

## 🌐 Website Strategy

### Pricing Display
- **Not publicly listed** (moving target)
- **Email-gated calculator**: 
  - Capture: # facilities, avg turn time, facility type
  - Whitelist: Business emails only (@gmail filtered)
  - Output: Custom scenario pricing

### Content Approach
- **Yard Builder Experience**: Visual configurator for facility-specific workflows
- **Scenario-based**: Drive-in vs. reefer vs. mixed
- **Confidence messaging**: "We've already thought about your facility type"
- **Video leverage**: Turn Jake's call content → social/blog/website (need Firefly video enabled)

## 🗓️ Near-Term Priorities (as of Jan 22)

1. **UFP RFQ** (Jake finishing Jan 23)
2. **Website launch** (target early week Jan 27)
3. **Manifest prep** (outreach strategy session needed)
4. **Modex planning** (follow-up campaign)
5. **Deck sharing** (Kendra deck, UFP pricing framework)

## 💬 Jake's Language Patterns

Use these verbatim:
- "Keep the driver in the truck"
- "Pays for itself with paper"
- "Standard protocol solution"
- "Yard network standard protocol system"
- "We solve for 100% of the problem, not 98%"
- "We don't kick any s*** back to you"
- "No exceptions - just figuring out how many workflows there are"

## 🎓 Training Principle
> "Confidence assuming the sale is 95% of it. Whether this guy gets it or doesn't, there's a bunch of other people that will. No water off my back."

*Desperation kills deals. Conviction closes them.*

---

**Key Insight**: The business has spent 7 years solving hard edge cases. Competitors (Outpost, etc.) solve for easy scenarios (closed fleets). Our advantage is handling the hard stuff (diverse inbound, variable facilities, 100% workflow coverage).

**Marketing Task**: Make that advantage obvious to prospects who don't yet know the problem is solvable.
