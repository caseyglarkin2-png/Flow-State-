Per our RFQ response, we meet nearly all of your needs, and those that we don’t meet, we’re willing to prioritize as a partners in our Co-Development Program (information in “Co-Development Program” section of this deck).

We’re the best choice because:

* Our solution has processed over 1M shipments with over 200K registered truck drivers from 1,000s of carriers (including brokered shipments) in partnership with one of the largest shippers in the world, Primo Brands (fka Nestle Waters)  
  * This deployment has been so successful that Primo Brands recently contracted with us to expand our SOW from 24 facilities to 260 facilities, ranging from their smallest to their largest, which highlights the resiliency and flexibility of our solution, which are requirements for these sorts of deployments  
  * Our solution is designed for adoption  
    * We were able to rollout our first 24 facilities in about 4 months, accelerating to multiple per week in the last month  
    * We’ve been able to passively onboard over 200K truck drivers using our proprietary non-app-based digital truck driver wallet, which improves driver check-in time  
  * Please review **“Other Considerations”** in the Appendix to further understand how our solution stands apart

Additionally, not only do we bring the best capabilities as we’ve shown in the RFQ and have demonstrated to you previously, but we bring the best partners for scale.  We bring:

* **Genlogs –** industry-leading machine vision solution (93% text accuracy 120-140 feet away with trailer traveling at 70 MPH, 15M images processed per day) that has the added benefit of a nationwide fraud identification and tracking network  
  * **Kyndryl –** $20B IT services company with 90K+ employees that has an industry-leading device management practice for procuring, installing and managing yard equipment (kiosks, cameras, etc.) at scale.

Other considerations

Has the system allowed for passive driver onboarding without the requirement of an app download, creation of a permanent user account or require knowledge of yard protocols / technology prior to arrival?

* Does the system provide a consistent user experience for truck drivers regardless of their technology adoption across modes (mobile / kiosk)?  
* Is the driver experience optimized in such a way that repeat drivers can more easily interact with the system, reducing check-in time?  
* Does the system allow for expansion into other relevant categories within yard management?  If so, please describe (yard mgt, digital BOL, etc.)  
* Has the system digitized all driver handoffs from check-in to check-out?  
* Has the system integrated with multiple systems, in real time, in both directions, leveraging the most partner-system-friendly data exchange mechanisms?  
* Has the system provided a reliable basis for automated execution of tasks within another integrated system of record (such as a WMS) based on execution and data exchange within your system?  
* Has the system demonstrated the ability to integrate with other YMS vendors?  
* Has the system demonstrated the ability to operate as a standalone YMS on top of driver experience functionality, should it be required?  
* Has the system demonstrated the ability to be deployed modularly based on facility needs?  
* Is the system flexible enough to work with a hardware spend-optimized strategy (e.g. commodity stationary tablets / printers can be used in indoor settings vs. specialized kiosks in outdoor settings vs. mobile tablets / mobile devices, etc.)?  
* Has the system been deployed at enterprise scale (10+ facilities)?  
* Does the vendor’s management team have a demonstrated expertise specifically in the carrier / driver experience world?  
* Does the vendor offer a formal "Design Partner" program that grants the customer voting rights on the product roadmap for specific functional verticals (e.g., Reefer, Flatbed)?  
* Has the vendor demonstrated the ability to operate a resilient system?


**Has the system allowed for passive driver onboarding without the requirement of an app download, creation of a permanent user account or require knowledge of yard protocols / technology prior to arrival?**

Passive onboarding (i.e. no or minimal training) of drivers into your deployed solution is paramount for scalability.  If drivers or carriers are asked to perform any task in order to participate in the driver experience at your facilities, the solution is likely to fail because dealing with carriers and drivers in this way is like herding cats.

* The most obvious request that driver-facing yard solutions may have of your carriers / drivers is to download an app.  This is because an app is the easiest way to create and retain permanent account information on a given device, avoid having to deal with browser-based complexity, capture additional data (such as streaming location) from drivers and , infiltrate the driver’s device in order to upsell software to the carrier.  
  * While this sounds good and the extra data capture sounds appealing, this requirement is effectively a non-starter from a scalability perspective due to driver app fatigue.  Carriers will specifically say that they are unwilling to enforce such rules on their drivers.   
* Other vendors may require that carriers and drivers perform some tasks prior to arrival, which can also cause friction in the onboarding process as most carriers, dispatchers and drivers will not participate  
* The ideal vendor will have no requirement for carriers / dispatchers / drivers to do or know anything about the solution prior to arrival and have a strategy for passive driver onboarding  
* Also, given the size of your deployment, I also think its important to have displayed this capability at scale.    
  * For example, we have passively onboard over **200K** drivers from across North America  
* 

* While a passive onboarding strategy is important, based on feedback that we’ve received, it’s also important to have a cohesive experience for truck drivers in the yard  
* What we’ve seen is that certain providers will provide an array of check-in experiences that switch between SMS, web, native app, GPS and QR codes all in one flow, which can create a confusing experience for truck drivers, especially for new drivers  
* Additionally, some providers will push mobile-only experiences that will alienate certain drivers that cannot or do not want to participate in that way  
* The ideal vendor will have a demonstrated track record of providing a consistent and logical experience for truck drivers across mobile and kiosk such that it optimizes success for new and repeat truck drivers in yards enabled by that vendor.    
  * For example, we have successfully processed over **1M** driver check-ins with a **0.2%** failure rate
