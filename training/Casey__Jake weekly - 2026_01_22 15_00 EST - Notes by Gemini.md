## Casey\<\>Jake weekly \- Transcript

### 00:00:00

   
**Casey Larkin:** Yeah,  
**Jake Koppinger:** and there was a  
**Casey Larkin:** I just started recording because we only have audio on Firefly and the video  
**Jake Koppinger:** noise.  
**Casey Larkin:** with the audio is gold for the web build and stuff.  
**Jake Koppinger:** Got it. Okay.  
**Casey Larkin:** So,  
**Jake Koppinger:** Okay. Yeah. Um so yeah it's uh  
**Casey Larkin:** can I see phase one?  
**Jake Koppinger:** like  
**Casey Larkin:** Can you give me some audio on phase one? Like that 14?  
**Jake Koppinger:** the this guy.  
**Casey Larkin:** Yeah.  
**Jake Koppinger:** Yeah. So phase one is is essentially this thing here.  
**Casey Larkin:** Okay.  
**Jake Koppinger:** So driver has to get out of the truck, walk into the dock office, check in or scan a QR code um from  
**Casey Larkin:** Yeah.  
**Jake Koppinger:** somewhere um check in and then once they're in, see if I uh yeah,  
**Casey Larkin:** Yeah. With you.  
**Jake Koppinger:** once they're in, then a lot of this stuff is the same. They're told where to go. They get loaded. uh they are asked to check out, they then uh check out, get their paperwork.  
   
 

### 00:01:09

   
**Jake Koppinger:** Even with a phase 2 solution where you've got this full gate automation. Um depending on the kiosk, right? If you've got one of these kiosks that has a printer in it, you can essentially check in, drive up, uh get loaded or unloaded, and then just go straight to the exit.  
**Casey Larkin:** Yeah.  
**Jake Koppinger:** And then this will print stuff at the exit. The tricky part with that is that takes time and so you could wind up with  
**Casey Larkin:** Yeah.  
**Jake Koppinger:** backups at the exit. So we're getting into some details here.  
**Casey Larkin:** But that's okay. Whatever.  
**Jake Koppinger:** this.  
**Casey Larkin:** This is super duper helpful. And I'm thinking of a world right now where we could build the website such that you  
**Jake Koppinger:** Um,  
**Casey Larkin:** know uh the right person at the right company reaches the right stage on the right page. They get served a piece of content, right, that, you know, everybody doesn't get, but they get because they work at a company that this would be relevant for. And we can walk them through um, you know, an evolved version of this animation to help them understand how it works for their facility.  
   
 

### 00:02:22

   
**Casey Larkin:** Kind of something of a yard builder experience.  
**Jake Koppinger:** Yep. M makes sense. Um but but yeah, so like the goal with all of this um where did my page go? Uh the the goal with all of this is as much as possible is to keep the driver in the truck throughout the whole thing. So the driver um  
**Casey Larkin:** right?  
**Jake Koppinger:** uh you know currently in in most cases even if they're like they might have to get out of the truck at the gate. They may have to get out the truck again once they've gone past the gate into a shipping and receiving office. They may have to get out of the truck again to go once they're done to go back into shipping and receiving office.  
**Casey Larkin:** Yeah.  
**Jake Koppinger:** Um, and then they may have to get out of the truck again at the gate when they're leaving in like a current scenario. Uh,  
**Casey Larkin:** What the  
**Jake Koppinger:** for Primo, it's only twice. They don't have gates. And in some gated scenarios, it's only twice, but typically it's twice.  
   
 

### 00:03:25

   
**Jake Koppinger:** And that adds typically five to 15 minutes of of uh uh trip time per trip to the dock  
**Casey Larkin:** Right.  
**Jake Koppinger:** office. So, what you know what our goal is to keep the driver in the truck. Um, in order to do that, you've got to enable them to check in while they're in the truck. You've got to enable them to get their instructions while they're in the truck. You've got to enable to we've got to enable them to get their um uh information, their their paperwork from inside the truck. You've got to enable them to get out of the yard while in the truck.  
**Casey Larkin:** Yeah,  
**Jake Koppinger:** Um, and so that sounds easy when until you start breaking down, well, what are the different scenarios, right? Like there are drivers that still pull up with flip phones.  
**Casey Larkin:** I think  
**Jake Koppinger:** So, and uh,  
**Casey Larkin:** Yeah.  
**Jake Koppinger:** you know, vast majority of drivers will not pre-check in because they're not we don't know the driver before they arrive. And and so when you get to that pinch point of that gate, they've got to be able to check in. They've got to be able to check in quick.  
   
 

### 00:04:30

   
**Jake Koppinger:** Um, and so there's different configurations for how you, you know, do that depending on, you know, you can set up QR codes along the entry, uh, before the gate to allow drivers to pull over, check in before getting to the gate and then go through. If there's not enough room for that, then you've got to make sure that the the uh process at the gate is very um very streamlined. Um so that they're not backing up the gate and just you know so  
**Casey Larkin:** defeat the purpose of the whole freaking  
**Jake Koppinger:** there right so there's a lot like this is why this is a difficult problem.  
**Casey Larkin:** thing.  
**Jake Koppinger:** Um and and so part of the thing about the workflows is all right well depending on your type of facility. Do you have a long driveway that they could pull over on the side or you have parking pre-staging parking they pull  
**Casey Larkin:** Yeah.  
**Jake Koppinger:** out on the side do all that or do you have a short driveway that's super backup sensitive? So for these facilities that have the short backup, a short driveway, do we need to have a super super fast uh flow like enter your reference number,  
   
 

### 00:05:39

   
**Casey Larkin:** Hello.  
**Jake Koppinger:** enter your phone number, let you through, and then complete the check-in process after the gate. Um, so that's what I mean by like we could have different workflows depending on the sort of the the situation. Um, and then what other information do you need?  
**Casey Larkin:** right?  
**Jake Koppinger:** Like reefers, for example, when they arrive, they need to know if it's a loaded trailer, they need to understand what the temperature is and what the set point is, what the uh fuel level is. Um,  
**Casey Larkin:** right?  
**Jake Koppinger:** and so right now there's a there's a person looking at that and writing it down and putting into a system or  
**Casey Larkin:** Yeah,  
**Jake Koppinger:** something.  
**Casey Larkin:** that should be part of what was,  
**Jake Koppinger:** So,  
**Casey Larkin:** you know, digital comms.  
**Jake Koppinger:** right, like how can we get the driver to upload that information or how can we get that information directly from the trailer  
**Casey Larkin:** Yeah.  
**Jake Koppinger:** itself? Um, for loaded trailers, loaded trailers typically you need to do a seal check. So, is a seal there?  
   
 

### 00:06:37

   
**Jake Koppinger:** Does the seal number match? And then the last piece is like the tug check. Is it actually like, you know, can you tug it and make sure that it hasn't been tampered with?  
**Casey Larkin:** What?  
**Jake Koppinger:** um that quite frankly is is the hardest thing.  
**Casey Larkin:** Yeah.  
**Jake Koppinger:** Uh but the other things are also not that easy because then you know the other again if you've got a driver with a flip phone you could easily say oh just go take a picture all this stuff but you have a driver that has a flip phone they're not going to be able to do that. So then what's the exception handling for that scenario?  
**Casey Larkin:** Right.  
**Jake Koppinger:** Do they need to like go park and go in and talk to somebody and pull them out of whatever they're doing to come out and check the seal for them? Like how how do you do that? Like we've talked about implementing like a uh like a a phone tied to the kiosk that they could pull off the kiosk and use like like a walk around the truck to like take pictures of this stuff or is there just a process that's still manual that has the somebody inside check the seal?  
   
 

### 00:07:37

   
**Casey Larkin:** Yeah. Or or do we pay gen logs to train their machine vision  
**Jake Koppinger:** Um,  
**Casey Larkin:** model to pick up trailer tags and confirm that stuff  
**Jake Koppinger:** yeah.  
**Casey Larkin:** works?  
**Jake Koppinger:** Yeah. I don't I don't think it's because of the tug check piece.  
**Casey Larkin:** Yeah,  
**Jake Koppinger:** Um,  
**Casey Larkin:** they can't talk with a  
**Jake Koppinger:** yeah,  
**Casey Larkin:** camera.  
**Jake Koppinger:** it's I mean I guess if you've got good enough resolution, you might be able to tell if something's been tampered with, but you've you've got to really hone in there.  
**Casey Larkin:** Yeah.  
**Jake Koppinger:** And also like reefer stuff, for example. Um,  
**Casey Larkin:** Yeah.  
**Jake Koppinger:** the the reefer units are all variable and a lot of times when you go to them, if you look at them, it's like a different screen. So, you know, you you push this button to show the set point. You push this button to show the fuel level. Camera can't do that passively. Somebody's got to be there to like push those buttons in order to make it available for somebody to see.  
   
 

### 00:08:39

   
**Jake Koppinger:** So, you've got you've got these like things that you've got to really figure out how you handle them  
**Casey Larkin:** Yeah.  
**Jake Koppinger:** um in, you know, in the situation.  
**Casey Larkin:** Yeah.  
**Jake Koppinger:** So, our software kind of like tries to go through all these scenarios and build up like a Go  
**Casey Larkin:** because you solve for all scenarios,  
**Jake Koppinger:** ahead.  
**Casey Larkin:** you know,  
**Jake Koppinger:** Right.  
**Casey Larkin:** yard network standard protocol system. That means we're not kicking any s\*\*\* back to you, right? You're not going to have to handle any exceptions. Um, you know, we understand if we're going to be an automation company in space, right? you know, we we don't solve for the 98%, right, and kick the 2% back that, you know, keep you up at night. We solve a 100% of the problem. It's just about figuring out how many workflows there  
**Jake Koppinger:** Yeah. Well, that's the goal.  
**Casey Larkin:** are.  
**Jake Koppinger:** I I think you'd you might wind up in a difficult situation if you try to claim that right now.  
   
 

### 00:09:43

   
**Jake Koppinger:** Um that's the goal though.  
**Casey Larkin:** Yeah.  
**Jake Koppinger:** But there are like there are things where it's it's literally impossible to solve like for example at least passively you know  
**Casey Larkin:** Exactly. Like, well, some of these uh processes,  
**Jake Koppinger:** um  
**Casey Larkin:** right, are just procedural b\*\*\*\*\*\*\* that have to be the way they are because of all the other inadequadeies that you have in the yard process, right? That you think is unique for the one facility. But, you know,  
**Jake Koppinger:** Yeah.  
**Casey Larkin:** I think what we might learn in that scenario is right, you know, you thought you needed 25, you actually really only have 10 or whatever it is, right? And we've figured out a better way to solve  
**Jake Koppinger:** Yeah.  
**Casey Larkin:** for  
**Jake Koppinger:** and and and like you know just to be honest with you like the you know when I talked to Lineage about this they're worried about this reefer problem right because there's they have probably I don't know every  
**Casey Larkin:** billion.  
**Jake Koppinger:** reef every reefer uh that like every reefer on the road goes to one of their facilities in a given year.  
   
 

### 00:10:51

   
**Casey Larkin:** Yeah.  
**Jake Koppinger:** Um like it's a it's they have a high percentage of the reefer. Anyway, the point being, not all those trucks are going to be hooked up with sensors,  
**Casey Larkin:** Mhm.  
**Jake Koppinger:** so you're not going to get full coverage on all the sensors. Um, and so they basically were like, "Look, you know, we're we're not going to be able to get rid of the guard and the guard check because we need somebody there to uh and we're not going to be able to rely on the the the truck, the trucker to adequately report the information about what's in the reefer because they can just lie, you know. Um, and I guess technically what they could do is send somebody out to do yard checks, which is what they what they kind of do. You know, that like that's what New Cole does. They have But now you've got somebody pulling up to every single truck or trailer  
**Casey Larkin:** Yeah.  
**Jake Koppinger:** looking at what the temperature is at the given time. So that takes forever if you've got, you know, 300 trailers in the yard.  
   
 

### 00:11:50

   
**Jake Koppinger:** Um, so what they're saying is we're not going to get out get rid of the guard anytime soon.  
**Casey Larkin:** Right.  
**Jake Koppinger:** Um, we're go we want something to enable them to be able to capture this information so that we've got a uh like images and a chain of of uh information about it. Um, and so this ties back all all the way to the the reason I'm talking about this. This ties back to the pricing and the ROI because a lot of these companies that are selling the whole uh uh like outpost, right? You know, this company the out whatever wherever it went, you know, they're selling getting rid of the person in the guard shack.  
**Casey Larkin:** Right.  
**Jake Koppinger:** Um,  
**Casey Larkin:** Like maybe it Yeah. You're just not ready for that.  
**Jake Koppinger:** well, this may work for truck terminals where it's it's like a Warner terminal and it's Warner  
**Casey Larkin:** Yeah. Exactly.  
**Jake Koppinger:** trucks coming in and um, you know, they they just need to see the driver and they need to recognize the truck in the trailer, but it doesn't work for a Lineage or Primo or any of these companies where there's a whole bunch of  
   
 

### 00:12:56

   
**Casey Larkin:** 100\.  
**Jake Koppinger:** different kinds of trucks and drivers coming coming And so the pricing that we're talking about  
**Casey Larkin:** Yes. Yes.  
**Jake Koppinger:** here is really it's really that's why I go back to the bill of lighting and trying to  
**Casey Larkin:** Yes.  
**Jake Koppinger:** justify the price of all this because a lot of people that have looked at all these automation solutions are like okay I'm I'm predicating this on me getting rid of headcount but I can't actually you know underwrite that as somebody internally. So what can I underwrite? what can't what can I back up in terms of my uh  
**Casey Larkin:** Mhm.  
**Jake Koppinger:** real cost savings from this?  
**Casey Larkin:** Yeah.  
**Jake Koppinger:** Um and so you know this all this other stuff that we're doing like all  
**Casey Larkin:** Yeah.  
**Jake Koppinger:** this pricing kind of comes back to like how much money you saving on paper because you can underwrite that. I'd be happy to underwrite 10 cents a page if my bill billsating are two pages long and I'm paying 20 cents per shipment. um you know I'm happy to to get this core solution here you know that's priced to uh uh with that sort of ROI in mind where  
   
 

### 00:14:06

   
**Casey Larkin:** Well,  
**Jake Koppinger:** it's like okay I'm going to get all this other s\*\*\*  
**Casey Larkin:** yeah.  
**Jake Koppinger:** know this is what Primo did right I'm getting all this other benefit faster truck turn times better visibility better visibility detention better visibility into my yard all this stuff but I'm paying for it with paper um and so maybe I can get rid of some headcount here and there and that just augments my ROI. So, I just went on a whole thing here,  
**Casey Larkin:** Yeah,  
**Jake Koppinger:** but um that's kind of  
**Casey Larkin:** you did the full circle. You did the trump.  
**Jake Koppinger:** go Yeah,  
**Casey Larkin:** You did the weave.  
**Jake Koppinger:** the weave indeed. Um but yeah,  
**Casey Larkin:** Any cool please share all these decks that  
**Jake Koppinger:** so the like  
**Casey Larkin:** you've given me a glance of um you may have  
**Jake Koppinger:** Yeah. And and I will say like,  
**Casey Larkin:** shared  
**Jake Koppinger:** you know, um an RFQ is different than selling, you know,  
**Casey Larkin:** 100%.  
**Jake Koppinger:** selling like an RFQ UFP already knows they have a problem.  
   
 

### 00:15:05

   
**Jake Koppinger:** They already know what their ROI looks like. They're just looking for the best solution.  
**Casey Larkin:** Yes.  
**Jake Koppinger:** Um and and so we've got to give them the best solution. And so long as it's within reason, uh price-wise, they already know what their ROI is. So, they're predicating their ROI on a bunch of s\*\*\* that I'm, you know, I'm sure is all the same stuff we've talked about, but I don't know what they're what they're really uh leaning on in terms of how to justify that. So, it's a different it's a different calculation when pricing something like this out, and it's a different pitch. Uh we've we've got to we've got to have the best uh product and hit mo,  
**Casey Larkin:** Yeah.  
**Jake Koppinger:** you know, the most requirements. Um, but when when we're selling to somebody that doesn't know they have a problem or they know they have a problem but they think that they don't need to solve it  
**Casey Larkin:** Mhm.  
**Jake Koppinger:** or want to solve it,  
**Casey Larkin:** Right. They don't know that a standard protocol solution  
   
 

### 00:15:49

   
**Jake Koppinger:** you know,  
**Casey Larkin:** exists.  
**Jake Koppinger:** right? And so like that's when it comes back to, you know, my opinion, you know, making it easy for them to understand the ROI. Um, you know, it pays for itself with paper.  
**Casey Larkin:** Yes.  
**Jake Koppinger:** Um, you can have all these bells and whistles if you want them. Um the ROI for that is  
**Casey Larkin:** Oh, but Jake, like do you have but like you know I've got drive in and you know facilities  
**Jake Koppinger:** here.  
**Casey Larkin:** that ship drivein and some that ship reefer. Um, oh look, you guys actually have already thought about that and you do have the solutions to those problems. So like if we can do that with our website and our marketing materials uh because we have thought about all this s\*\*\*, it's, you know,  
**Jake Koppinger:** Yeah.  
**Casey Larkin:** we can try to make it as much of a one-sizefits-all uh brand that does give people the confidence to understand and change their frame of mind, right? because like people don't know what they don't know, right?  
   
 

### 00:16:53

   
**Jake Koppinger:** Yeah.  
**Casey Larkin:** Um there are sure there's a whole bunch of other companies out there with similar workflows to UFP, right? So like you know, how do we make those folks aware that are dealing with the same problems hypothetically, right? That you know, yard flow exists and we've thought about you.  
**Jake Koppinger:** Yeah. Yeah, it makes sense. I think uh I'm happy to word vomit more on this stuff because I, you know, just think about it all the time.  
**Casey Larkin:** Yeah,  
**Jake Koppinger:** I I feel like I've forgotten a bunch of stuff because it, you know, you know,  
**Casey Larkin:** you know,  
**Jake Koppinger:** I have than I know now.  
**Casey Larkin:** you know, you've forgotten more than we'll ever know.  
**Jake Koppinger:** Um,  
**Casey Larkin:** But yeah, exactly. Um,  
**Jake Koppinger:** uh,  
**Casey Larkin:** so  
**Jake Koppinger:** but I have like decks going back years that have all this stuff has been in my head and it's been kind of like but it  
**Casey Larkin:** And you talk about a lot of this s\*\*\*  
**Jake Koppinger:** evolves.  
**Casey Larkin:** too. if we could get your video calls turned on for Firefly and like I could have access to you know your videos like could train the agents to like digest that stuff take what is useful and like redeploy it into like you know social posts, blogs and s\*\*\* for the website etc etc and some approval cue or whatever.  
   
 

### 00:18:16

   
**Casey Larkin:** Um, but this is super powerful. If we could get your video turned on, there's no telling what type of stuff we might be able to to do to just turn up the volume for  
**Jake Koppinger:** Yeah, fair. Fair enough.  
**Casey Larkin:** us.  
**Jake Koppinger:** Um uh okay. Um yeah, anyway, dialing this all back. Um we I'll I'll send all this stuff to you.  
**Casey Larkin:** Cool.  
**Jake Koppinger:** Um, when I get when I finish our uh UFB tomorrow, I will jump on the website. Um, and then we can aim to get it up Monday or Tuesday of next week. And then, um, maybe we set up a time early the week next week to start going over manifest and how we uh how we do the outreach.  
**Casey Larkin:** Yep. And then after that, we got to talk Modeex. Uh,  
**Jake Koppinger:** Um  
**Casey Larkin:** but I think I've got a little model coming together that will be nice for us to run for manifest or modex or anything else we're um campaigning for.  
**Jake Koppinger:** yeah.  
   
 

### 00:19:27

   
**Jake Koppinger:** Yep.  
**Casey Larkin:** Cool.  
**Jake Koppinger:** For sure. Um cool.  
**Casey Larkin:** I'm getting excited,  
**Jake Koppinger:** Yeah.  
**Casey Larkin:** man.  
**Jake Koppinger:** No, me too. It's uh I mean it's it's f\*\*\*\*\*\* slo in this business with these big ass companies,  
**Casey Larkin:** Right?  
**Jake Koppinger:** but what was  
**Casey Larkin:** Like your seven years of just like, you know, slow,  
**Jake Koppinger:** that?  
**Casey Larkin:** methodical work, banging your head against the wall, wondering, am I dumbass for even trying to solve this? Uh, all going to be worth it here soon.  
**Jake Koppinger:** Yeah. Yeah. I I I hope that's the case. But uh yeah, no, it's uh I like There we  
**Casey Larkin:** manifest it or I mean um a little double entandra there.  
**Jake Koppinger:** go.  
**Casey Larkin:** But seriously though, um confidence assuming the sale is 95% of it, right?  
**Jake Koppinger:** Yeah.  
**Casey Larkin:** like being able to just whether this guy gets it or he doesn't get it, like I don't really give a s\*\*\* because um there's a whole bunch of other people that will get it.  
   
 

### 00:20:39

   
**Casey Larkin:** It's no water off my back uh type of attitude goes goes a long way towards making people antsy to buy s\*\*\*.  
**Jake Koppinger:** Yeah. Yep. No, it's uh very very fair. Um and I'm excited about this this uh gen logs thing. Um I mean  
**Casey Larkin:** I'm super excited about kind of firming up the pricing as well,  
**Jake Koppinger:** that  
**Casey Larkin:** right? Your um enhanced versus  
**Jake Koppinger:** Yeah.  
**Casey Larkin:** core  
**Jake Koppinger:** Yeah, we're just going to bake the like basically gen logs will be we use Twilio  
**Casey Larkin:** Come  
**Jake Koppinger:** for sending text messages. So that's a piece of our cogs.  
**Casey Larkin:** on.  
**Jake Koppinger:** We're just going to eat the cost um and sell it as part of the the package in enhanced. So it doesn't seem it's essentially white labeling it um as opposed to having it as an add-on. And I, you know, I think that's that feels like the right approach. I think having machine vision makes the overall package more valuable. So, um,  
   
 

### 00:21:47

   
**Casey Larkin:** Yeah.  
**Jake Koppinger:** and then, you know, we'll see where that relationship goes, but I got I got to hop in a minute for another call. Um,  
**Casey Larkin:** Cool.  
**Jake Koppinger:** yeah.  
**Casey Larkin:** I'm glad it's the pricing that they that they did.  
**Jake Koppinger:** Any  
**Casey Larkin:** I think it's indicative of their willingness to um hopefully work with us and do some cool s\*\*\* in the future.  
**Jake Koppinger:** Yeah, for sure. No, I think it's uh I I think it's an interesting opportunity for both  
**Casey Larkin:** I couldn't believe it. I calculated $40,000 of  
**Jake Koppinger:** sides.  
**Casey Larkin:** what um a facility.  
**Jake Koppinger:** Yeah.  
**Casey Larkin:** Um cool.  
**Jake Koppinger:** Yeah. No,  
**Casey Larkin:** All right, I'll let you jump.  
**Jake Koppinger:** it's a  
**Casey Larkin:** And can you just send me those decks just like quickly and  
**Jake Koppinger:** Yep.  
**Casey Larkin:** uh see if we can't make them pretty and part of the story  
**Jake Koppinger:** Yep.  
**Casey Larkin:** and making it easy for you to review  
**Jake Koppinger:** Yep.  
**Casey Larkin:** things  
**Jake Koppinger:** I will send you the the Kendra deck.  
   
 

### 00:22:55

   
**Jake Koppinger:** This  
**Casey Larkin:** and that pricing even though understanding right that it's a work in process. um be good to at least get some initial framing up on the site just like um what was that one you were showing me the YMS core enhanced model?  
**Jake Koppinger:** the pricing.  
**Casey Larkin:** Yeah. What was the competitor again? Go Outpost.  
**Jake Koppinger:** Oh, outpost.  
**Casey Larkin:** It wasn't Gate Go Outpost. Okay. Yeah, that would be good if we could get something up on our site that uses that same um price  
**Jake Koppinger:** Yeah,  
**Casey Larkin:** framing.  
**Jake Koppinger:** I'm still working through this this pricing with uh for UFP, but I'll send you what I've got right now. Um I I don't really want to put pricing on the website.  
**Casey Larkin:** Cool.  
**Jake Koppinger:** I don't know if it's on there now, but  
**Casey Larkin:** I get that perspective. I'm hoping it's something that I can get you to change your mind on.  
**Jake Koppinger:** um  
**Casey Larkin:** I think it's a good thing to have publicly available, especially if we can do it in such a fashion where it's, you know, we guarantee the person viewing it in that frame, you know, sees the value u and that scale  
   
 

### 00:24:19

   
**Jake Koppinger:** the the pro the The problem is it it just is  
**Casey Larkin:** sliding  
**Jake Koppinger:** a it's a pretty sizable moving target. Like I just completely redid the way I did pricing this morning.  
**Casey Larkin:** Right.  
**Jake Koppinger:** So like it  
**Casey Larkin:** But it's like but yeah at the same time though it's like  
**Jake Koppinger:** it  
**Casey Larkin:** not really you kind of just rebundled the you know four digital modules into a core base model and then you know our all the RTLS machine vision cool stuff is in the enhanced version.  
**Jake Koppinger:** Well, the RTLS isn't in there yet because we're not offering it. I mean, it that will be that will be another add-on. Um because that will be I don't even know yet what the economics of that looks like. Um because you know what?  
**Casey Larkin:** Right.  
**Jake Koppinger:** like the the way that we're doing the gate with like the 10 cents per shipment is really good pricing for the gate.  
**Casey Larkin:** All right.  
**Jake Koppinger:** If we've got um a someone doing yard check twice a shift and we've got three shifts um and they've got 200 or 300 trailers in their yard and we're sending you know basically each facility if we've got 160 facilities and they're doing um you  
   
 

### 00:25:45

   
**Casey Larkin:** Yeah, exactly.  
**Jake Koppinger:** know two yard checks per shift it's 200 facilities to make the math easy it's you know it's called a thousand per facility.  
**Casey Larkin:** Yeah.  
**Jake Koppinger:** Basically, you we got 160 facilities, 160,000 API calls a day. Um, which changes the math considerably. That that turns that business into $16,000 a day with that  
**Casey Larkin:** Heat.  
**Jake Koppinger:** pricing. And if you multiply that by 365, you're now in the millions of dollars that we're paying them to do the RTLS. So I don't know yet that that model will work for that. Um my gut says probably not just based on  
**Casey Larkin:** Yeah.  
**Jake Koppinger:** that uh that sort of um a quick analysis. So I haven't that that will be an incremental module um we'll have to  
**Casey Larkin:** Cool. Whatever.  
**Jake Koppinger:** figure out how that works.  
**Casey Larkin:** Okay, that's totally fine. There are enough cool bells and whistles in the enhanced model, right? Uh we can just like weave the RTLS into the messaging whenever is appropriate.  
   
 

### 00:26:57

   
**Casey Larkin:** Um but just having an understanding of what else is included and what we are currently offering because it does solve a lot of problems is great. um like understanding right like how many more people we will reduce in that specific use case you were just talking about is great but how much cooler would it be if they came into uh the RFP process or into reaching out uh with the understanding that okay not just eliminating all these people but you know got to be able to ship more freight and each one of my facilities is going to be a million or two $3 million more profitable than it was previously. So like yes, the people are nice, but I get the bigger picture and we've got champions and and we want to roll this out as soon as possible because we understand the value of thinking about things from aworked  
**Jake Koppinger:** Yeah. Well,  
**Casey Larkin:** perspective.  
**Jake Koppinger:** that's different discussion than the pricing, but I I do got to hop because I'm super late for this other call. Let's pick this up again next week.  
   
 

### 00:28:03

   
**Jake Koppinger:** Um or tomorrow,  
**Casey Larkin:** Cool.  
**Jake Koppinger:** whatever.  
**Casey Larkin:** Yeah, just please give me the decks. I'll try to make it as easy as possible for you to be cool with the website by next week. And if we don't want to do pricing publicly, we can just kill that page. But  
**Jake Koppinger:** Well, I I'm I'm a little bit more okay if we're doing it through like a um what's  
**Casey Larkin:** um  
**Jake Koppinger:** it called? Like a uh uh not a payw wall,  
**Casey Larkin:** yeah,  
**Jake Koppinger:** but like provide me your information and then you can see pricing type  
**Casey Larkin:** yeah, yeah.  
**Jake Koppinger:** thing.  
**Casey Larkin:** Yes. Okay. All right. a variable pricing engine based on the use case.  
**Jake Koppinger:** Well, no,  
**Casey Larkin:** test.  
**Jake Koppinger:** more like uh it's not publicly available and if you want to see it,  
**Casey Larkin:** I know how  
**Jake Koppinger:** you have to provide us with your email.  
**Casey Larkin:** many.  
**Jake Koppinger:** Um and then we we look to do some potential whitelisting of like, okay, this this person that's atgmail.com, maybe we don't show them the pricing. They've got to have like a legitimate email. I don't know. Um anyway,  
**Casey Larkin:** And anyways, I'll let you you go, but if we could get them to share how many facilities they have, what the average turn time is,  
**Jake Koppinger:** Right.  
**Casey Larkin:** and have the email address that we're looking for,  
**Jake Koppinger:** Right.  
**Casey Larkin:** right? Then like maybe that's a scenario where you'd be like, "Oh, okay. Here's what uh the workflows at your situation would cost you." That's good.
