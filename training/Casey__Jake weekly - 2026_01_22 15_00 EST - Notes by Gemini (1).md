### Summary

Jake Koppinger outlined the initial phase one solution requiring drivers to exit the truck for check-in and paperwork retrieval, while emphasizing that the overarching goal of automation is to keep drivers in the truck throughout the entire process, which currently adds five to 15 minutes per trip. Key challenges discussed include accommodating various workflows due to differing facility layouts and addressing specific information needs for specialized trailers like reefers, which require manual checks for elements like temperature and seal presence, alongside the difficulty of eliminating the guard check due to concerns over sensor coverage and driver trustworthiness. The discussion between Mr. Koppinger and Casey Larkin also focused on justifying pricing through quantifiable savings, such as paper reduction, and developing a sales and marketing strategy that positions Yard Flow as a standard protocol solution, including the strategic use of Mr. Koppinger's expertise for website content, pricing structure, and the Gen Logs partnership.

### Details

* **Phase One Solution Overview** Jake Koppinger described phase one of the process, which requires the driver to exit the truck to check in at the dock office, either by walking in or scanning a QR code. After checking in, they are directed for loading or unloading, asked to check out, and then receive their paperwork ([00:00:00](?tab=t.87hxognuoko1#heading=h.r49st6k2rmgn)). Mr. Koppinger noted that even with a phase two full gate automation solution, if the kiosk has a printer, drivers could check in, get loaded/unloaded, and print paperwork at the exit, though this might cause backups due to the time it takes ([00:01:09](?tab=t.87hxognuoko1#heading=h.ty7awq2ujcxy)).

* **Goal of Driver Stay-in-Truck Automation** The overarching goal of the automation is to keep the driver in the truck throughout the entire process, minimizing the current scenario where drivers may have to exit the truck multiple times, for example, at the gate, shipping/receiving office, and the exit gate ([00:02:22](?tab=t.87hxognuoko1#heading=h.htzsr5iil9kx)). Jake Koppinger explained that forcing drivers to get out of the truck adds typically five to 15 minutes per trip. Achieving the goal requires enabling drivers to check in, receive instructions, and obtain paperwork all while remaining in the truck ([00:03:25](?tab=t.87hxognuoko1#heading=h.mk3hunbn4s40)).

* **Challenges and Workflow Variability** A significant challenge in implementation is the variety of scenarios, such as drivers using flip phones and the inability to rely on pre-check-ins because the driver is often unknown before arrival, requiring quick check-in at the pinch point of the gate ([00:03:25](?tab=t.87hxognuoko1#heading=h.mk3hunbn4s40)). Due to facility type variations, like having a long driveway for pre-staging parking or a short, backup-sensitive driveway, different workflows are necessary, such as a super-fast flow (entering reference and phone number) to complete check-in after the gate ([00:04:30](?tab=t.87hxognuoko1#heading=h.4hguc1kewl4o)). Casey Larkin suggested building the website to serve highly relevant content, potentially an evolved animation of the workflow, to the right person at the right company for their specific facility, calling this a "yard builder experience" ([00:01:09](?tab=t.87hxognuoko1#heading=h.ty7awq2ujcxy)).

* **Handling Specific Trailer Information and Checks** Additional information gathering is necessary for specialized trailers, such as reefers, which require knowing the loaded trailer status, temperature, set point, and fuel level, typically a manual process today. Jake Koppinger detailed that loaded trailers also require a seal check (seal presence and number match) and a "tug check" to ensure the trailer hasn't been tampered with ([00:05:39](?tab=t.87hxognuoko1#heading=h.72glvmueqyau)). For the seal check, Mr. Koppinger mentioned that exception handling is needed for drivers with flip phones who cannot easily take pictures, considering options like a phone tied to the kiosk for walkarounds or a manual process where an internal employee checks the seal ([00:06:37](?tab=t.87hxognuoko1#heading=h.p8rhfqvs7xkf)).

* **Automation Limitations and Guard Presence** Casey Larkin suggested training Gen Logs' machine vision model to detect trailer tags, but Jake Koppinger noted this is difficult due to the tug check and the variable nature of reefer units that require pushing buttons for information like set point and fuel level ([00:06:37](?tab=t.87hxognuoko1#heading=h.p8rhfqvs7xkf)). Mr. Koppinger shared that companies like Lineage, due to concerns about obtaining full sensor coverage and the trustworthiness of driver reporting, are not planning to eliminate the guard check anytime soon ([00:10:51](?tab=t.87hxognuoko1#heading=h.pcir6p7vd1bo)). Instead, they want a solution that enables the guard to capture information, such as images, to maintain a chain of information, which ties back to ROI and pricing ([00:11:50](?tab=t.87hxognuoko1#heading=h.5lf1e21x2mao)).

* **Pricing and ROI Justification** Mr. Koppinger highlighted that the pricing and ROI must be justified, particularly because many automation solutions predicate their value on reducing headcount, which is not always feasible for companies with diverse inbound trucks and drivers, such as Lineage or Primo ([00:11:50](?tab=t.87hxognuoko1#heading=h.5lf1e21x2mao)). The current pricing strategy focuses on justifying costs through quantifiable savings, such as paper reduction from bills of lading, which can be underwritten at a specific price per shipment ([00:12:56](?tab=t.87hxognuoko1#heading=h.24cgkidt2yuc)). This core solution, which offers benefits like faster truck turn times and better yard visibility, is often augmented by potential headcount reduction, further enhancing the ROI ([00:14:06](?tab=t.87hxognuoko1#heading=h.v787rej4vm6h)).

* **Sales Strategy and Standard Protocol Solution** For an RFQ scenario like UFP, Jake Koppinger stated that the company already knows their ROI and is seeking the best solution, so the focus is on having the best product that meets most requirements ([00:15:05](?tab=t.87hxognuoko1#heading=h.gljgioq3hl45)). When selling to those who are unaware of or hesitant to solve the problem, the strategy is to make the ROI easy to understand, emphasizing that the solution "pays for itself with paper" while offering optional advanced features. Casey Larkin agreed that a one-size-fits-all approach in marketing that addresses various scenarios, like drive-in and reefer facilities, can build confidence and change the prospect's frame of mind, establishing Yard Flow as a standard protocol solution ([00:15:49](?tab=t.87hxognuoko1#heading=h.qvykgbudzgsv)).

* **Website and Marketing Material Development** Casey Larkin emphasized the importance of utilizing Jake Koppinger's extensive knowledge, suggesting turning on video calls for Firefly so that AI agents can digest the content and redeploy it into social posts, blogs, and other marketing materials for the website ([00:16:53](?tab=t.87hxognuoko1#heading=h.v5ft65jp76u9)). Jake Koppinger confirmed they would send decks, including the Kendra deck and current UFP pricing framework, and planned to work on the website and aim for a launch early the following week. The team also planned to schedule a time to review the manifest and outreach strategy, followed by a discussion on Modex ([00:18:16](?tab=t.87hxognuoko1#heading=h.4qiewqk6252u)) ([00:22:55](?tab=t.87hxognuoko1#heading=h.ip2lqpypg0x9)).

* **Pricing Structure and Future Modules** The team discussed the pricing structure, specifically the "enhanced" package, where Jake Koppinger proposed white-labeling the Gen Logs machine vision cost rather than having it as an add-on, believing this makes the overall package more valuable ([00:20:39](?tab=t.87hxognuoko1#heading=h.uqsdzd3btxid)). Regarding the enhanced vs. core model, Mr. Koppinger clarified that RTLS (Real-Time Locating Systems) is not currently offered and would be a future, incremental add-on due to the potentially high costs, possibly reaching millions of dollars annually based on a quick analysis of API calls for frequent yard checks ([00:24:19](?tab=t.87hxognuoko1#heading=h.jisjl3eoysls)). Casey Larkin stated that they can weave RTLS into messaging when appropriate, focusing on the current enhanced model's value ([00:25:45](?tab=t.87hxognuoko1#heading=h.lihrvzyk4a5g)).

* **Website Pricing Display and Data Collection** Jake Koppinger expressed reluctance to put pricing publicly on the website due to its rapidly changing nature ([00:22:55](?tab=t.87hxognuoko1#heading=h.ip2lqpypg0x9)). However, they were more open to a model where users provide their information, like an email address, to view the pricing. Casey Larkin suggested this process could also involve collecting data like the number of facilities and average turn time to present a variable pricing engine specific to the user's situation ([00:28:03](?tab=t.87hxognuoko1#heading=h.ruiue4ek4wbf)).

* **Gen Logs Partnership** Both speakers were excited about the Gen Logs collaboration, with Casey Larkin noting that the pricing offered by Gen Logs suggests their willingness to work together ([00:20:39](?tab=t.87hxognuoko1#heading=h.uqsdzd3btxid)). Mr. Larkin mentioned calculating a potential cost of $40,000 per facility based on the pricing model ([00:21:47](?tab=t.87hxognuoko1#heading=h.2r50i2dqk78d)).
