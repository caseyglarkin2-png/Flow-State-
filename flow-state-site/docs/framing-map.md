# Framing Map (PASS 3)

Principle: every page pays off attention with micro‑rewards (clarity, reveal, progress), and creates urgency via real operational stakes (dwell, detention, labor) — no fake scarcity.

## Home (/)
- Hook: “Visibility ≠ control. YardFlow by FreightRoll makes the yard obey.”
- Tension: motion without control; timestamps are not action.
- Reveal: yard → network of intelligent nodes.
- Proof: micro metrics + vignette.
- CTA: YardBuilder report (PDF) + Book demo.

## Product (/product)
- Hook: mental model first (“control loop for the yard”).
- Tension: radios/spreadsheets create drift.
- Reveal: enforceable workflow + defensible timestamps.
- Proof: cage match vs legacy.
- CTA: generate report / book demo.

## Solutions (/solutions)
- Hook: missions (trigger → break → intervention → outcome).
- Tension: compounding network chaos.
- Reveal: standardization compounds ROI.
- Proof: mission cards.
- CTA: ROI model.

## YardBuilder (/yardbuilder)
- Hook: “Map the yard. Name the bottleneck. See the stakes.”
- Tension: hidden cost in dwell.
- Reveal: report preview before email.
- Proof: auto-calc based on inputs.
- CTA: generate report (PDF).

## ROI (/roi)
- Hook: “Board-ready ROI story.”
- Tension: finance distrusts soft math.
- Reveal: assumptions + progressive breakdown.
- Proof: exportable modeled summary.
- CTA: export ROI PDF.

## Pricing (/pricing)
- Hook: how buying works.
- Tension: why $/facility varies.
- Reveal: complexity selector.
- Proof: transparent inclusions.
- CTA: quote / demo.

## Confidence pages (/security, /integrations, /implementation)
- Hook: procurement doesn’t panic.
- Tension: “does it plug in / is it safe / how painful is rollout”.
- Reveal: one-pager downloads.
- Proof: current controls + roadmap labeled.
- CTA: get quote.
