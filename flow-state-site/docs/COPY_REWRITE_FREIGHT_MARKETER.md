## Hero

**H1:**  
You don't have 37 facilities. You have one network that nobody orchestrates.

**Subhead:**  
Traditional yard systems treat each site like an island. YardFlow is a Yard Network System: one control plane, standardized protocols, multi-site intelligence. Stop managing facilities. Start orchestrating networks.

**Proof bullets:**
- 50% dwell reduction across network rollouts (modeled)
- [PLACEHOLDER]% Year-1 ROI on 5% deployment ramp (needs validation)
- 70% gate labor savings through automated carrier verification
- 8-week avg. time to production per facility
- Real detention recovery, not detention guessing

**Status quo callout:**  
Your current YMS was built to optimize Yard 12. It has no idea Yard 12 is part of a 40-yard network. Every site runs different playbooks. Carrier intelligence dies at the property line. Visibility ends when the trailer rolls out. You're managing friction, not flow.

**YNS reframing:**  
A Yard Network System doesn't just track assets at Site A. It learns from every carrier interaction across your network, enforces standardized protocols, and spots patterns no single-site system can see. One application. One dataset. One invoice. Network-wide orchestration.

**Persona callouts:**  
- **CFO:** Detention you can't verify. Expedites for delays you can't see. Overtime because arrival windows are fiction. That's the network leak. Measure it in 15 minutes.
- **Ops:** Your best yard runs 24-min dwell. Your worst runs 52. YNS finds out why and fixes it everywhere.
- **Security:** Unknown carriers. Fake credentials. Zero audit trail. Digital Guard verifies every driver before they touch your dock.

## Section: The Category Shift (YMS vs YNS)

**H1:**  
YMS optimizes sites. YNS orchestrates networks.

**Subhead:**  
Yard Management Systems were built for single facilities. Yard Network Systems were built for enterprises with 10+ sites that need to act like one organism.

**Proof bullets:**
- YMS: Local yard data only. YNS: Cross-network predictive analytics.
- YMS: Manual dispatch per site. YNS: AI-powered move recommendations across sites.
- YMS: Linear scaling cost. YNS: Compounding returns with each site added.
- YMS: Isolated carrier history. YNS: Network-wide carrier benchmarking.
- YMS: Site-by-site security theater. YNS: Unified identity verification with audit trail.

**Status quo callout:**  
Legacy YMS vendors pitch you on "digital transformation" but their architecture is still site-by-site selling. They'll gladly sell you 40 licenses for 40 facilities. Each one runs in its own silo. Intelligence doesn't transfer. Playbooks don't standardize. Your "network" is a spreadsheet.

**YNS reframing:**  
A network system treats your 40 facilities as nodes in one intelligent graph. Carrier performance at Site 3 informs gate decisions at Site 22. Dock utilization benchmarks flow across regions. Exception patterns get spotted before they become leaks. This isn't bigger YMS. This is a different category.

**Persona callouts:**  
- **CFO:** Every new site makes the network smarter. ROI compounds, it doesn't just add.
- **Ops:** Standardized playbooks mean Site 41 doesn't start from zero. Rollout speed doubles.
- **IT:** One platform. One API. One auth layer. Not 40 vendor integrations.

## Section: The Network Leak (Diagnostic Frame)

**H1:**  
The leak exists because your network is fragmented.

**Subhead:**  
You're not bleeding margin at one facility. You're bleeding it everywhere, in 8 hidden categories, because every yard runs a different playbook and produces incompatible data.

**Proof bullets:**
- **Detention fees:** $180/event × [PLACEHOLDER] events/year (needs validation)
- **Expedite charges:** Premium freight on delays you couldn't see coming
- **Gate overtime:** 3 FTE × $28/hr × 4 unplanned hrs/week per site
- **Dwell inefficiency:** 48-min avg dwell = throughput you're leaving on table
- **Safety stock bloat:** Working capital tied up because you can't trust your own ETA data
- **Lost dock turns:** <70% utilization because you can't coordinate inbound flow
- **Compliance exposure:** Driver qualification gaps Secretary Duffy wants to make YOUR liability
- **Data labor tax:** Manual reconciliation of incompatible yard data

**Status quo callout:**  
Most operations teams think "leak" means detention fees. That's one category. The real leak is network-wide: every facility runs different protocols, produces different data formats, and has zero visibility into what's happening two sites over. High-performing Site 7 has learnings Site 23 will never see. That's the leak.

**YNS reframing:**  
Network leak is an outcome of network variance. YNS eliminates variance by standardizing the control plane. One check-in protocol. One BOL format. One carrier identity layer. When playbooks align and data flows, the leak stops. Not because you "optimized dwell." Because you orchestrated the network.

**Persona callouts:**  
- **CFO:** Run the diagnostic. If you're bleeding >$2M/year in recoverable costs, you'll want a demo.
- **Ops:** Leak quantification is how you sell the board. Start here.
- **Security:** Cargo theft happens when chain-of-custody breaks. Digital BOL closes that gap.

## Section: Ground Truth (Why Current Systems Lie)

**H1:**  
You can't cut costs you can't see. YardFlow makes the invisible auditable.

**Subhead:**  
Legacy systems record what someone typed in after the fact. YardFlow captures what actually happened, timestamped by the physical yard.

**Proof bullets:**
- **Reported arrival** ± 47-min variance → **Gate camera timestamp** (defensible to the second)
- **Estimated dwell** (pure fiction) → **Actual spot-to-dock duration** (48 min → 24 min avg post-deployment)
- **Guessed detention** (you pay or fight) → **Auditable proof** (recover what's yours)
- **Manual dock assignments** (radios + whiteboards) → **AI move recommendations** (based on network learnings)
- **Clipboard check-ins** (zero security) → **OCR + photo capture** (carrier identity verified)

**Status quo callout:**  
Your current system asks drivers when they arrived. Drivers lie (or forget, or round). Detention disputes become he-said-she-said. Dwell metrics are guesses. You're flying blind with an altimeter someone scribbled on a napkin.

**YNS reframing:**  
Ground Source Truth means defensible timestamps from cameras, kiosks, and dock sensors. Not "reported" data. Not "estimated" dwell. What actually happened, with audit-ready proof. This is how you stop paying detention you don't owe and start charging detention you're owed.

**Persona callouts:**  
- **CFO:** Auditable proof = detention recovery = [PLACEHOLDER] annually (needs validation).
- **Ops:** Real dwell data means you can finally manage it. Can't improve what you can't measure.
- **Security:** Chain-of-custody timestamps protect you when cargo goes missing.

## Section: Network Effect Flywheel

**H1:**  
Site 1 cuts friction. Site 10 creates intelligence. Site 40 compounds returns.

**Subhead:**  
YMS vendors sell you linear value: pay per site, get local ROI. YNS delivers compounding value: every site makes the network smarter, rollouts faster, and exceptions rarer.

**Proof bullets:**
- **Sites 1-5:** Local efficiency gains. Benchmarking starts.
- **Sites 6-15:** Pattern recognition unlocks. AI recommendations improve.
- **Sites 16+:** Network effect flywheel spins. Each site makes prior sites smarter.
- **Standardized playbooks:** Site 41 deploys in 3 weeks, not 8 (playbook already exists).
- **Cross-site learnings:** Best practices from Site 7 auto-propagate to Site 23.

**Status quo callout:**  
With traditional YMS, Site 40 is just as hard to deploy as Site 1 was. No shared learnings. No playbook transfer. Every rollout starts from zero. Your "network" has no network effects.

**YNS reframing:**  
Network effects mean compounding returns. Site 10's carrier data improves Site 2's gate decisions. Site 30's dwell optimizations inform Site 15's dock scheduling. Each node strengthens the graph. This is why YNS ROI accelerates while YMS ROI flatlines.

**Persona callouts:**  
- **CFO:** Year 1 ROI = [PLACEHOLDER]%. Year 3 ROI = [PLACEHOLDER]%. Compounding, not linear. (needs validation)
- **Ops:** Faster rollouts. Smarter systems. Better outcomes. That's the network effect.
- **IT:** One platform scales better than 40 platforms. Exponentially better.

## FAQ

**Q: Is this just YMS with better branding?**  
A: No. YMS = single-site optimization. YNS = multi-site orchestration with network intelligence. Different architecture. Different outcomes. If you only have 1-2 yards, stick with YMS. If you have 10+, you need network-level coordination.

**Q: What if my facilities are too different to standardize?**  
A: Every facility is a special snowflake until you instrument it. YNS doesn't force identical operations. It enforces identical data formats and identity protocols. Your Site 7 can run 24/7 while Site 12 runs dayshift only. The network still learns from both.

**Q: How long until we see ROI?**  
A: Payback period = [PLACEHOLDER] months at enterprise scale (needs validation). Detention recovery alone often covers Year 1 licensing. Gate labor savings and dwell reduction accelerate from there.

**Q: Do we need to rip out our existing WMS/TMS?**  
A: No. YNS sits upstream of WMS (warehouse) and downstream of TMS (transport). We integrate via API. Most customers keep their WMS and add YNS for yard orchestration.

**Q: What's the smallest network size that makes sense?**  
A: 5+ facilities. Below that, single-site YMS is fine. Above 10, network effects start compounding and YNS becomes the obvious choice.

**Q: Can we pilot at one site before rolling out?**  
A: Yes. Typical path: POC at 1 gate lane (Week 1, $15k), Pilot at full facility (Day 30, custom pricing), Network rollout (Day 90+, enterprise agreement). Prove value small, scale fast.

# Page: Security & Compliance

## Hero

**H1:**  
Carrier identity. Cargo security. Driver qualification compliance.

**Subhead:**  
Unknown drivers are your biggest operational security risk. Cargo theft happens when chain-of-custody breaks. Secretary Duffy wants to make driver qualification YOUR liability. Digital Guard + Digital BOL solve all three.

**Proof bullets:**
- Automated carrier ID verification (OCR license scan + photo capture)
- Real-time authentication against carrier database (reject fakes at gate)
- Digital chain-of-custody for every load (cargo theft prevention)
- CDL validation + English proficiency documentation (DOT compliance)
- Audit-ready proof for detention recovery and liability protection

**Status quo callout:**  
Your current process: clipboard check-in, maybe a photo, maybe not. No verification. No audit trail. Unknown carriers get waved through. If cargo goes missing, you have zero chain-of-custody proof. If a driver causes an incident and wasn't qualified, Secretary Duffy's new rules make YOU liable.

**YNS reframing:**  
Digital Guard makes carrier identity the foundation, not an afterthought. Every driver gets verified before they touch your property. OCR + photo + real-time auth. Digital BOL creates timestamped chain-of-custody for every load. DOT compliance becomes automatic, not aspirational. Audit trail is the byproduct, not the project.

**Persona callouts:**  
- **Security/LP:** Stop cargo theft before it starts. Chain-of-custody tracking for every trailer movement.
- **Ops:** No more unknown drivers wandering your yard. Gate rejections happen in 30 seconds, not 30 minutes.
- **CFO:** Shipper liability protection = avoiding one major incident pays for itself 10x over.

## Section: Operational Security (Primary Focus)

**H1:**  
The three security gaps keeping you up at night.

**Subhead:**  
Carrier identification. Cargo theft. Driver qualification compliance. Digital check-in and BOL process that actually solves them.

**Proof bullets:**
- **Carrier Identity Verification:** OCR scan + photo + real-time database auth. Fake credentials rejected at gate.
- **Cargo Theft Prevention:** Digital BOL creates timestamped chain-of-custody. Know who moved what, when.
- **Driver Qualification Compliance:** CDL validation + English proficiency check. Shipper liability protection under Secretary Duffy's proposed regulations.
- **Unauthorized Access Prevention:** Flagged drivers auto-rejected. No gatehouse discretion needed.
- **Audit Trail by Default:** Every gate transaction logged. DOT/FMCSA compliance built in.

**Status quo callout:**  
Most "yard security" is theater. Clipboard check-ins. Manual photo capture (if you're lucky). No real-time verification. Unknown carriers get waved through daily. When cargo goes missing, you have zero proof of who moved it. When DOT audits driver qualifications, you scramble to find paper records.

**YNS reframing:**  
Security starts at identity. Digital Guard verifies every carrier before gate access. OCR license scan + photo capture + real-time authentication against carrier database. Digital BOL timestamps every load movement. Chain-of-custody becomes automatic. Driver qualification compliance becomes a byproduct of check-in, not a separate audit scramble.

**Persona callouts:**  
- **Security/LP:** Cargo theft drops when thieves know they're on camera and verified. Chain-of-custody proof protects you.
- **Ops:** Gate throughput improves when verification is automated. No more radio calls to confirm drivers.
- **CFO:** One cargo theft incident = [PLACEHOLDER] cost. Prevention ROI is obvious. (needs validation)

## Section: Data Security & Compliance

**H1:**  
SOC 2 Type II. GDPR/CCPA ready. Enterprise-grade infrastructure.

**Subhead:**  
Everything procurement needs to check the boxes and move forward.

**Proof bullets:**
- **Infrastructure:** AWS GovCloud-eligible. Multi-region redundancy. 99.9% uptime SLA.
- **Data encryption:** AES-256 at rest. TLS 1.3 in transit. Zero-knowledge architecture available.
- **Access controls:** Role-based access control (RBAC). Multi-factor authentication (MFA). SSO/SAML support.
- **Compliance posture:** SOC 2 Type II in progress. GDPR/CCPA frameworks implemented. Regular penetration testing.
- **Audit trail:** Immutable event logs. Retention policies configurable. Export to SIEM via API.

**Status quo callout:**  
Most yard systems were built before cloud security was a thing. On-prem servers in a closet. No encryption. Admin passwords on Post-its. Compliance is a hope, not a posture.

**YNS reframing:**  
Enterprise-grade security by default, not by upgrade. Cloud-native architecture. Encryption everywhere. Audit logs immutable. Procurement can check every box without negotiating addendums.

**Persona callouts:**  
- **IT/Security:** API-first design. Integrates with your existing auth (SSO/SAML). Logs export to your SIEM.
- **Legal/Compliance:** SOC 2 Type II in progress. GDPR/CCPA frameworks already implemented. Pen-tested quarterly.
- **CFO:** No hidden compliance costs. Enterprise tier includes security posture you'd pay extra for elsewhere.

## FAQ

**Q: How do you verify carrier identity in real time?**  
A: OCR scan of driver's license + photo capture at kiosk → cross-reference against carrier database → real-time authentication (approve/reject in <30 seconds). Flagged credentials auto-rejected. No gatehouse discretion needed.

**Q: What if a driver doesn't have their credentials?**  
A: Digital Guard rejects them at the gate. Manual override available for supervisors, but it's logged and flagged. Exception = audit trail.

**Q: How does Digital BOL prevent cargo theft?**  
A: Every load movement gets timestamped: who, what, when, where. Chain-of-custody proof is automatic. If cargo goes missing, you have defensible trail for investigation + insurance claim.

**Q: What about Secretary Duffy's driver qualification rules?**  
A: Proposed regulations make shippers liable for ensuring drivers are qualified (CDL valid, English proficiency for road signs, safe to operate 50K+ lb loads). Digital Guard documents qualification at check-in. Audit-ready proof that shields you from liability.

**Q: Do we need dedicated IT resources to manage this?**  
A: No. Cloud-hosted, fully managed. Your IT team integrates via API (SSO, SIEM export, WMS/TMS hooks). No on-prem servers. No maintenance windows.

**Q: Can we export security logs for compliance audits?**  
A: Yes. Immutable event logs. Export to CSV, JSON, or push to your SIEM via API. Configurable retention policies (default = 7 years).

## Module 1: Digital Guard

**H1:**  
Automated carrier verification. 70% gate labor reduction.

**Subhead:**  
Your biggest security risk is unknown drivers on your property. Digital Guard verifies every carrier before they enter. Self-service kiosks. OCR license scanning. Real-time authentication. Gate throughput up. Labor cost down.

**Proof bullets:**
- OCR license scan + photo capture (30-second check-in)
- Cross-reference against carrier database (real-time auth)
- Flagged credentials rejected at gate (no supervisor call needed)
- CDL validation + English proficiency documentation (DOT compliance)
- Audit trail by default (every transaction logged)
- 70% gate labor reduction (3 FTE → 0.5 FTE per site, modeled)

**Status quo callout:**  
Manual check-ins. Clipboards. Radios. 3 people at the gate just to verify who showed up. Unknown carriers waved through because nobody has time to call and confirm. Security theater, not security.

**YNS reframing:**  
Self-service kiosks with OCR + photo + real-time verification. Drivers check in themselves. Gate staff monitor exceptions only. Unknown carriers get auto-rejected. Labor cost drops 70%. Security posture improves 10x.

**Persona callouts:**  
- **Ops:** Gate throughput up. Labor cost down. Driver experience better (no waiting in line).
- **Security:** Carrier identity verified before property access. Audit trail automatic.
- **CFO:** 70% labor reduction = $[PLACEHOLDER]/site/year (needs validation). ROI in <6 months.

## Module 2: Digital BOL

**H1:**  
Touchless documentation. Timestamped chain-of-custody. Detention recovery proof.

**Subhead:**  
Paper BOLs get lost. Manual signatures get disputed. Detention becomes he-said-she-said. Digital BOL timestamps every handoff. Chain-of-custody is automatic. Detention recovery is defensible.

**Proof bullets:**
- Electronic signature capture (mobile + kiosk)
- Timestamped load events (gate-in, dock-start, dock-end, gate-out)
- Photo proof at every step (trailer condition, seal integrity)
- Automatic detention calculation (based on actual timestamps, not estimates)
- Dispute resolution evidence (defensible in arbitration)
- $[PLACEHOLDER]/site/year in detention recovery (needs validation)

**Status quo callout:**  
Paper BOLs in the cab. Signatures illegible. Timestamps rounded to nearest hour. Detention disputes become legal battles. You pay fees you don't owe because you can't prove arrival time.

**YNS reframing:**  
Digital BOL creates timestamped chain-of-custody for every load. Gate camera confirms arrival. Dock sensor confirms dock time. Mobile app captures signature. Photo proof at every step. Detention calculation is automatic and defensible. Recovery rate goes from 20% to 85%.

**Persona callouts:**  
- **Finance:** Detention recovery = $[PLACEHOLDER] annually (needs validation). This module pays for itself in 90 days.
- **Ops:** No more lost BOLs. No more detention disputes. Chain-of-custody proof automatic.
- **Legal:** Defensible timestamps in arbitration. Photo evidence of trailer condition.

## Module 3: Digital Comms

**H1:**  
Direct driver messaging. 40+ languages. Zero radio dependency.

**Subhead:**  
Radios are chaos. Language barriers cause delays. Drivers circle the yard looking for instructions. Digital Comms sends direct messages to driver mobile app. Real-time translation. Visual dock maps. Radio-free yard operations.

**Proof bullets:**
- Direct driver messaging (push notifications to mobile app)
- Real-time translation (40+ languages supported)
- Visual dock maps (driver sees exactly where to go)
- Automated status updates (no radio check-ins needed)
- Exception escalation (geofence violations auto-alert ops)
- [PLACEHOLDER]% reduction in dwell time from clearer communication (needs validation)

**Status quo callout:**  
Radio calls every 5 minutes. "Driver, where are you?" "Driver, go to Dock 12." Language barriers turn simple instructions into 20-minute loops. Dwell time leaks because drivers can't find the dock.

**YNS reframing:**  
Digital Comms sends instructions directly to driver's phone. Real-time translation. Visual maps show exactly where to go. Status updates automatic. Radios go silent. Dwell time drops because communication friction disappears.

**Persona callouts:**  
- **Ops:** Radio-free operations. Exception management only. Dwell reduction from clearer comms.
- **Drivers:** Clear instructions in their language. Visual maps. No circling the yard.
- **CFO:** Dwell reduction = throughput increase = $[PLACEHOLDER]/site/year (needs validation).

## Module 4: Digital YMS

**H1:**  
Real-time asset tracking. AI move recommendations. Network-wide visibility.

**Subhead:**  
Where's that trailer? Radio the yard jockey. Check the log. Maybe walk the yard. Digital YMS knows where every asset is in real-time. AI recommends optimal moves. Multi-site visibility in one dashboard.

**Proof bullets:**
- Real-time asset tracking (GPS + geofence + camera)
- AI-powered move recommendations (based on network learnings)
- Drag-and-drop yard map (visual asset positioning)
- Cross-site visibility (see your entire network in one view)
- Sub-5min deployment per new facility (playbook already standardized)
- [PLACEHOLDER]% improvement in dock utilization (needs validation)

**Status quo callout:**  
Trailer hunts. Radio calls. Whiteboard yard maps. No idea if that trailer is at Dock 7 or still in the staging lane. Asset tracking is manual guesswork.

**YNS reframing:**  
Digital YMS puts every trailer on the map in real-time. AI recommends next moves based on dock availability, driver proximity, and network learnings from other sites. Drag-and-drop interface. Yard jockeys execute moves, system optimizes flow. Network visibility means you can see all 40 yards in one dashboard.

**Persona callouts:**  
- **Ops:** Trailer hunts eliminated. Dock utilization up. Move optimization automatic.
- **IT:** Sub-5min deployment per site. Standardized playbook. One API.
- **CFO:** Throughput increase = $[PLACEHOLDER]/site/year (needs validation).

## FAQ

**Q: Can we deploy modules one at a time?**  
A: Yes. Most customers start with Digital Guard (security + gate labor savings). Add Digital BOL next (detention recovery). Layer in Comms and YMS as needed. Modular by design.

**Q: Do all modules share the same data?**  
A: Yes. One platform. Carrier identity from Digital Guard flows into Digital BOL. Asset tracking from Digital YMS informs Digital Comms messages. Data doesn't silo.

**Q: What if we only want YMS without the other modules?**  
A: You can license Digital YMS standalone, but you're missing the network effect. Digital Guard + BOL create the identity and documentation layer that makes YMS orchestration smarter. Most customers see higher ROI with combined deployment.

**Q: How long to deploy all four modules?**  
A: Typical timeline: Digital Guard in Week 1 (kiosk install + config). Digital BOL in Week 2 (mobile app rollout). Digital Comms in Week 3 (driver onboarding). Digital YMS in Week 4 (yard mapping + asset tagging). Full network module deployment = 8 weeks avg.

# Page: YNS Framework

## Hero

**H1:**  
You don't have 50 yards. You have one network nobody orchestrates.

**Subhead:**  
Traditional Yard Management Systems treat each facility as an island. YardFlow is a Yard Network System: multi-site intelligence, standardized protocols, compounding returns. Stop managing sites. Start orchestrating networks.

**Proof bullets:**
- **YMS:** Single-site optimization. **YNS:** Multi-site orchestration.
- **YMS:** Local data only. **YNS:** Cross-network predictive analytics.
- **YMS:** Linear scaling cost. **YNS:** Compounding returns with each site.
- **YMS:** Site-by-site security. **YNS:** Unified identity verification.
- **YMS:** No network effects. **YNS:** Each site makes prior sites smarter.

**Status quo callout:**  
Your current YMS was architected for managing one yard really well. It has no idea that yard is part of a 40-facility network. Carrier learnings don't transfer between sites. Playbooks don't standardize. Intelligence dies at the property line. You're managing friction one facility at a time.

**YNS reframing:**  
A Yard Network System treats your facilities as nodes in one intelligent graph. Carrier performance at Site 3 informs gate decisions at Site 22. Dwell optimizations at Site 7 propagate to Site 15. Exception patterns get spotted network-wide before they become leaks. This isn't "bigger YMS." This is a different category.

**Persona callouts:**  
- **CFO:** Network effects mean compounding ROI, not linear ROI. Year 3 returns exceed Year 1.
- **Ops:** Standardized playbooks mean Site 41 deploys in 3 weeks, not 8. Learnings transfer.
- **IT:** One platform scales exponentially better than 40 platforms.

## Section: YMS vs YNS Comparison

**H1:**  
The difference between managing yards and orchestrating networks.

**Subhead:**  
If you have 1-2 facilities, YMS is fine. If you have 10+, you need network-level coordination.

**Comparison table:**
| Capability | Traditional YMS | YardFlow YNS |
|---|---|---|
| Scope | Single-site optimization | Multi-site network orchestration |
| Intelligence | Local yard data only | Cross-network predictive analytics |
| Move coordination | Manual dispatch per site | AI-powered recommendations across sites |
| Carrier visibility | Appointment tracking | Real-time ETA + detention prevention |
| Security model | Site-by-site access control | Unified identity verification + audit trail |
| Network effects | None (linear scaling) | Exponential value with each site added |
| Benchmarking | Compare your sites to each other | Compare against anonymized network data |
| Scaling cost | Linear (pay per site) | Sublinear (network discounts kick in) |
| Playbook transfer | None (every site starts from zero) | Standardized playbooks accelerate rollout |
| Data portability | Siloed per site | One dataset across network |

**Status quo callout:**  
YMS vendors will happily sell you 40 licenses for 40 facilities. No shared intelligence. No playbook standardization. Site 40 is just as hard to deploy as Site 1 was. Your "network" is an Excel file.

**YNS reframing:**  
YNS architecture is built for networks from Day 1. One control plane. Shared intelligence. Standardized protocols. Each new site makes the network smarter, rollouts faster, and returns higher. This is why enterprises with 10+ facilities migrate from YMS to YNS.

**Persona callouts:**  
- **CFO:** YMS = linear cost, linear ROI. YNS = sublinear cost, compounding ROI.
- **Ops:** Playbook standardization means faster rollouts and better outcomes.
- **IT:** API-first design. One integration, not 40.

## FAQ

**Q: At what network size does YNS make sense?**  
A: 5+ facilities = YNS starts showing value. 10+ facilities = YNS is the obvious choice. Below 5, stick with traditional YMS.

**Q: Can we migrate from our existing YMS to YNS?**  
A: Yes. Most customers run YMS and YNS in parallel during transition (3-6 months). Historical data migrates via API. Zero downtime cutover.

**Q: Do we have to standardize operations across all sites?**  
A: No. You standardize data formats and identity protocols. Operations can stay site-specific. Site 7 can run 24/7 while Site 12 runs dayshift only. The network still learns from both.

**Q: What if some sites are DCs and others are manufacturing?**  
A: YNS handles mixed facility types. DC playbooks differ from manufacturing playbooks, but carrier identity and BOL protocols stay consistent. Network intelligence still transfers.

**Q: How long until network effects kick in?**  
A: Sites 1-5: Local efficiency gains. Sites 6-15: Pattern recognition unlocks. Sites 16+: Flywheel spins. Network effects accelerate after 10 sites.

# Message Map: Core Persuasion Architecture

**In priority order, these are the site's core claims:**

1. **Category invention:** You don't have 37 facilities. You have one network. YNS orchestrates it. YMS can't.

2. **The leak is the proof:** Network leak exists because facilities run different playbooks and produce incompatible data. Measure it. Then stop it.

3. **Ground truth beats guesswork:** Current systems record what someone typed in after the fact. YardFlow captures what actually happened with defensible timestamps. Detention recovery follows.

4. **Network effects compound:** Site 1 cuts friction. Site 10 creates intelligence. Site 40 compounds returns. YMS scales linearly. YNS compounds exponentially.

5. **Modular deployment controls risk:** Start with Digital Guard (security + gate labor). Add Digital BOL (detention recovery). Layer in Comms and YMS as network matures. Pay for what you deploy. See ROI before scaling.
