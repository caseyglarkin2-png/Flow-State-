### Section 1: Category Invention (always visible)

**Module Title:** YNS vs YMS: Why "yard management" doesn't scale

**Collapsed (Layer 1):**  
Traditional YMS treats each facility as an island. YNS orchestrates the network. That's the category. One application. One dataset. Network-wide intelligence.

**Expanded (Layer 2 - Proof):**
| Capability | Legacy YMS | YardFlow YNS |
|---|---|---|
| Scope | Single-site optimization | Multi-site orchestration |
| Intelligence | Local data only | Cross-network analytics |
| Security | Site-by-site access control | Unified identity verification |
| ROI pattern | Linear per facility | Compounding network effects |
| Deployment | Custom per site (slow) | Standardized playbooks (fast) |

**Expanded (Layer 3 - How):**  
YNS architecture means carrier performance at Site 3 informs gate decisions at Site 22. Dock utilization benchmarks flow across regions. Exception patterns get spotted network-wide. This isn't bigger YMS. This is a different category.

### Section 2: Three Pillars (collapsible)

**Module Title:** Orchestration. Security. Intelligence.

**Collapsed (Layer 1):**  
YardFlow gives you three things site-by-site systems can't: real-time orchestration across facilities, unified carrier identity verification, and network intelligence that compounds with scale.

**Expanded (Layer 2 - Proof):**

**Orchestration:**
- Real-time asset tracking across all facilities
- AI move recommendations based on network learnings
- Drag-and-drop yard maps (visual positioning)
- Metric: Sub-5 min deployment per new facility

**Security:**
- Automated carrier ID verification (OCR + photo + real-time auth)
- Digital BOL chain-of-custody for every load
- Driver qualification compliance (DOT/FMCSA audit trail)
- Metric: 70% gate labor reduction

**Intelligence:**
- Cross-site carrier benchmarking
- Predictive ETA (learns from network patterns)
- Network-wide exception detection
- Metric: Each site makes prior sites smarter

**Expanded (Layer 3 - How):**  
Deploy Digital Guard first (security + gate labor savings). Add Digital BOL next (detention recovery). Layer in Orchestration and Intelligence as network matures. Modular rollout. Incremental ROI.

**Proof Artifact:** [Link to Product Modules deep-dive]

**Next Step:** See implementation archetypes →

### Section 3: ROI Reality Check (collapsible)

**Module Title:** Board-ready in 3 minutes. Deep model when you're ready.

**Collapsed (Layer 1):**  
Run the interactive ROI model. Configure your facility mix. See Year-1 realization. Export assumptions as PDF for finance review. No black boxes.

**Expanded (Layer 2 - Proof):**

**Quick Model (3 min):**
- Select facility count + throughput tier
- See modeled Year-1 ROI + payback period
- Export board-ready summary (PDF)
- Use case: Initial qualification, exec summary for board

**Deep Model (15 min):**
- Customize all inputs (labor rates, detention frequency, dwell baselines)
- Adjust deployment ramp + network effect multipliers
- See year-by-year projections (5-year view)
- Export detailed assumptions + methodology
- Use case: Finance validation, procurement diligence

**Key Metrics (enterprise baseline):**
- [X]% Year-1 ROI (5% network rollout)
- [X] month payback period
- 65% detention recovery rate
- 70% gate labor reduction

**Expanded (Layer 3 - How):**  
Both models use the same economics engine. All assumptions are visible and editable. Methodology is published. No magic multipliers.

**Proof Artifact:** [Link to Economics Methodology doc]

**Next Step:** Run the model →

### Section 4: Network Effect Flywheel (collapsible)

**Module Title:** Site 1 cuts friction. Site 10 creates intelligence. Site 40 compounds returns.

**Collapsed (Layer 1):**  
YMS scales linearly (pay per site, get local ROI). YNS compounds exponentially (each site makes the network smarter, rollouts faster, returns higher).

**Expanded (Layer 2 - Proof):**

**Sites 1-5:** Local efficiency gains. Benchmarking starts.  
**Sites 6-15:** Pattern recognition unlocks. AI recommendations improve.  
**Sites 16+:** Network effect flywheel spins. Each site makes prior sites smarter.

**Concrete Examples:**
- Site 1 deployment: 8 weeks (building playbook from scratch)
- Site 10 deployment: 5 weeks (playbook exists, refined)
- Site 40 deployment: 3 weeks (playbook standardized, team trained)

- Year 1 ROI: [X]%
- Year 3 ROI: [X]% (compounding, not linear)

**Expanded (Layer 3 - How):**  
Standardized playbooks mean Site 41 doesn't start from zero. Carrier intelligence transfers between facilities. Dock optimization learnings propagate network-wide. This is why enterprises with 10+ facilities migrate from YMS to YNS.

**Proof Artifact:** [Interactive Network Effect Simulator]

**Next Step:** See the simulation →

### Section 5: Implementation Archetypes (collapsible)

**Module Title:** Your facilities aren't identical. Our rollout playbooks adapt.

**Collapsed (Layer 1):**  
We've mapped 6 yard archetypes (gated/guarded, non-gated, backup-sensitive, scale-heavy, cross-dock, manufacturing). Each has a different workflow + YardFlow config. You get the rollout plan that matches your network.

**Expanded (Layer 2 - Proof):**

**6 Archetypes:**
1. **Gated/Guarded:** High security. Full Digital Guard deployment.
2. **Non-gated:** Open access. Geofence + mobile check-in.
3. **Backup-sensitive:** Detention risk. Digital BOL priority.
4. **Scale-heavy:** High throughput. Orchestration + AI moves.
5. **Cross-dock:** Fast turns. Real-time comms + visual maps.
6. **Manufacturing:** Complex workflows. Custom integrations.

**What Changes Per Archetype:**
- Module prioritization (which to deploy first)
- Kiosk vs mobile vs hybrid check-in
- Integration requirements (WMS, TMS, ERP)
- Rollout timeline (3 weeks to 8 weeks)

**Expanded (Layer 3 - How):**  
We audit your network. Map each facility to an archetype. Hand you a rollout plan with sequencing, resource requirements, and expected ROI curve. No cookie-cutter deployment.

## PAGE: YNS (CATEGORY)

**Goal:** Educate on the category distinction (YMS vs YNS) and position YardFlow as the inevitable choice for 10+ facility networks.

### HERO

**Headline:**  
Yard Network System (YNS): The category YardFlow invented.

**Subhead:**  
Traditional YMS optimizes single facilities. YNS orchestrates multi-site networks. Different architecture. Different outcomes. If you have 10+ yards, this is the category you're buying.

**3 Bullets:**
- YMS = site-by-site optimization. YNS = network orchestration.
- YMS = linear ROI. YNS = compounding returns.
- YMS = custom per site. YNS = standardized playbooks.

**Primary CTA:**  
Get Your Network Rollout Plan

**Secondary CTA:**  
Compare YMS vs YNS (Full Table)

---

### Section 1: The Problem with Site-by-Site Thinking (always visible)

**Copy:**  
Your current YMS was architected for managing one yard really well. It has no idea that yard is part of a 40-facility network. Carrier learnings don't transfer. Playbooks don't standardize. Intelligence dies at the property line. You're managing friction one facility at a time. That's the tax.

---

### Section 2: YMS vs YNS (Full Comparison) (collapsible)

**Module Title:** What changes when you shift from site-by-site to network-level

**Collapsed (Layer 1):**  
YMS was built for single facilities. YNS was built for networks. Every capability differs. See the full comparison.

**Expanded (Layer 2 - Full Table):**

| Capability | Traditional YMS | YardFlow YNS |
|---|---|---|
| **Scope** | Single-site optimization | Multi-site network orchestration |
| **Data model** | Isolated per site | One dataset across network |
| **Intelligence** | Local yard data only | Cross-network predictive analytics |
| **Carrier visibility** | Appointment tracking | Real-time ETA + network benchmarking |
| **Move coordination** | Manual dispatch per site | AI-powered recommendations across sites |
| **Security model** | Site-by-site access control | Unified identity verification + audit trail |
| **Network effects** | None (linear scaling) | Exponential value with each site added |
| **Benchmarking** | Compare your sites to each other | Compare against anonymized network data |
| **Playbook transfer** | None (every site starts from zero) | Standardized playbooks accelerate rollout |
| **Scaling cost** | Linear (pay per site) | Sublinear (network discounts kick in) |
| **Deployment speed** | 8+ weeks per site (custom config) | 3-5 weeks per site (standardized playbook) |
| **ROI pattern** | Year 1 = Year 3 (linear) | Year 3 > Year 1 (compounding) |

**Expanded (Layer 3 - When to Choose Each):**

**Stick with YMS if:**
- You have 1-4 facilities
- Each facility is wildly different (no standardization possible)
- You're optimizing for deep customization per site

**Choose YNS if:**
- You have 5+ facilities (10+ is the sweet spot)
- You want standardized playbooks that transfer learnings
- ROI needs to compound, not just add

### Section 3: Network Effects in Practice (collapsible)

**Module Title:** How each new site makes the entire network smarter

**Collapsed (Layer 1):**  
Site 1 gives you local efficiency. Site 10 unlocks pattern recognition. Site 40 creates a learning flywheel. This is why YNS ROI compounds.

**Expanded (Layer 2 - Proof):**

**Concrete Examples:**

**Carrier Intelligence Transfer:**
- Site 3 learns Carrier ABC always runs 30 min late on Tuesdays
- Site 22 auto-adjusts dock scheduling for Carrier ABC
- Network-wide improvement, zero manual config

**Playbook Standardization:**
- Site 1 deployment: Build playbook from scratch (8 weeks)
- Site 10 deployment: Refined playbook (5 weeks)
- Site 40 deployment: Standardized playbook (3 weeks)

**Exception Pattern Detection:**
- Geofence violations at Site 7 trigger alerts at Site 15
- Detention spikes at Site 12 inform pricing at Site 3
- Network spots patterns single-site systems miss

**Expanded (Layer 3 - How):**  
One control plane. One dataset. Learnings propagate automatically. You don't configure cross-site intelligence. It's the architecture.

**Proof Artifact:** [Interactive Network Effect Simulator]

**Collapsed (Layer 1):**  
All ROI projections use a single economics engine. Assumptions are visible and editable. Methodology is published. No hidden multipliers.

**Expanded (Layer 2 - Key Assumptions):**

**Cost Categories (8):**
1. Gate labor reduction (70% avg via Digital Guard)
2. Detention recovery (65% recovery rate via Digital BOL)
3. Dwell reduction (48 min → 24 min avg via Orchestration)
4. Expedite avoidance (visibility prevents emergency freight)
5. Dock utilization improvement (<70% → 85%+)
6. Working capital release (safety stock reduction)
7. Compliance risk mitigation (driver qualification audit trail)
8. Data labor elimination (automated reconciliation)

**Network Effect Multiplier:**
- Sites 1-5: 1.0x (local efficiency only)
- Sites 6-15: 1.2x (pattern recognition unlocks)
- Sites 16+: 1.5x (flywheel spins)

**Deployment Ramp Defaults:**
- Year 1: 5% of network
- Year 2: 25% of network
- Year 3: 60% of network
- Year 4: 90% of network
- Year 5: 100% of network

**Expanded (Layer 3 - Validation):**  
All baselines calibrated against Primo/Singularity simulation data + real deployment metrics. Conservative assumptions by default (use "expected" scenario, not "best case").

**Proof Artifact:** [Download full Economics Methodology (PDF)]

---

### Section 4: Sensitivity Analysis (collapsible)

**Module Title:** Best case, expected case, conservative case

**Collapsed (Layer 1):**

**Expanded (Layer 2 - Scenarios):**

**Conservative:**
- 50% gate labor reduction (vs 70% expected)
- 50% detention recovery (vs 65% expected)
- No network effect multiplier (1.0x across all sites)
- Slower deployment ramp (3% Year 1)
- Result: [X]% Year-1 ROI, [X] month payback

**Expected:**
- 70% gate labor reduction
- 65% detention recovery
- Standard network effect multiplier (1.0x → 1.5x)
- Standard deployment ramp (5% Year 1)
- Result: [X]% Year-1 ROI, [X] month payback

**Best Case:**
- 85% gate labor reduction
- 80% detention recovery
- Accelerated network effect multiplier (1.0x → 2.0x)
- Aggressive deployment ramp (10% Year 1)
- Result: [X]% Year-1 ROI, [X] month payback

**Expanded (Layer 3 - How to Use):**  
Finance teams: run all three scenarios. Present expected case to board. Use conservative for risk mitigation. Best case shows upside potential.

### Section 1: Operational Security (always visible)

**The Three Gaps:**

**1. Carrier Identity Verification**  
Unknown drivers are your biggest operational risk. Digital Guard verifies every carrier before gate access. OCR license scan + photo capture + real-time authentication against carrier database. Flagged credentials rejected instantly.

**Metric:** 70% gate labor reduction + zero unauthorized yard access

**2. Cargo Theft Prevention**  
Digital BOL creates timestamped chain-of-custody for every load. Know who moved what, when. If cargo goes missing, you have forensic-grade proof for investigation + insurance claim.

**Metric:** 65% detention recovery rate (auditable timestamps)

**3. Driver Qualification Compliance**  
Secretary Duffy's proposed regulations make shippers liable for driver qualifications (CDL valid, English proficiency for 50K+ lb loads). Digital Guard documents qualification at check-in. Audit-ready proof shields you from liability.

**Metric:** DOT/FMCSA compliance built into check-in (not separate audit scramble)

### Section 3: Archetype-Specific Workflows (collapsible)

**Module Title:** What changes per archetype (workflow + config)

**Collapsed (Layer 1):**  
Each archetype has different module prioritization, check-in methods, and integration requirements. See how workflows adapt.

**Expanded (Layer 2 - Examples):**

**Example 1: Gated/Guarded (High Security)**

**Workflow:**
1. Driver approaches gate → kiosk check-in
2. OCR license scan + photo capture
3. Real-time verification against carrier database
4. Flagged credentials → rejected (no gate access)
5. Approved → gate opens, dock assignment sent via SMS
6. Driver proceeds to dock → Digital BOL check-in at dock
7. Load complete → Digital BOL signature capture
8. Gate-out timestamp → detention calculation automatic

**YardFlow Config:**
- Modules: Digital Guard (full), Digital BOL, Digital Comms
- Check-in: Kiosk (mandatory for all carriers)
- Integrations: TMS (appointment data), WMS (dock assignments)
- Security: RBAC roles for gate staff, ops managers, security team

**Example 2: Non-Gated (Open Access)**

**Workflow:**
1. Driver self-check-in via mobile app (before arriving)
2. Geofence entry triggers "on-site" status
3. Digital Comms sends dock assignment + visual map
4. Driver proceeds directly to dock (no gate stop)
5. Mobile app check-in at dock → Digital BOL timestamped
6. Load complete → mobile signature capture
7. Geofence exit triggers gate-out timestamp

**YardFlow Config:**
- Modules: Digital Comms, Mobile check-in, Digital BOL
- Check-in: Mobile app (no kiosk needed)
- Integrations: TMS (carrier pre-notification)
- Security: Geofence alerts for unexpected entries

## 3. YARD ARCHETYPES MINI-DECK OUTLINE

**Format:** 10-12 slides, sales asset (PDF + interactive web version)

**Slide 1: Title**  
Yard Archetypes: Rollout Playbooks for Every Facility Type

**Slide 2: The Problem**  
Your facilities aren't identical. Cookie-cutter deployments fail. We've mapped 6 archetypes.

**Slide 3: The 6 Archetypes (Overview)**  
- Gated/Guarded (High Security)
- Non-Gated (Open Access)
- Backup-Sensitive (Detention Risk)
- Scale-Heavy (High Throughput)
- Cross-Dock (Fast Turns)
- Manufacturing (Complex Workflows)

**Slides 4-9: One Slide Per Archetype**

Each slide includes:
- **Profile:** Facility characteristics
- **Priority modules:** Which YardFlow modules deploy first
- **Check-in method:** Kiosk, mobile, hybrid
- **Workflow changes:** Before/after comparison
- **Deployment timeline:** 3-10 weeks (depends on complexity)
- **ROI drivers:** Gate labor, detention, dwell, etc.
- **Example use cases:** Industries/facility types

**Slide 10: Multi-Archetype Networks**  
Most enterprises have mixed archetypes. We map each facility, sequence rollout, and hand you the plan.

**Slide 11: Deployment Sequencing Strategy**  
- **Phase 1:** Pilot at 1-2 facilities (prove value)
- **Phase 2:** Scale to highest-ROI archetypes first (backup-sensitive, scale-heavy)
- **Phase 3:** Expand to full network (unlock network effects)

**Slide 12: Next Steps**  
Book a network audit. We'll map your facilities and hand you the rollout plan.
