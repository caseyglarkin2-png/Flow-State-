# PASS 5 — Flow Spine (CFO Gravity Well + Persona Paths)

Non‑negotiables honored
- No fabricated customers/compliance/metrics. Any number shown is explicitly modeled.
- Flow: Belief → Proof → Safety → Buy → Act.
- Every page ends with “Next best step” persona routing (Finance / Ops / IT / Procurement).
- Accessibility, performance, reduced motion.

## Primary CFO Journey (CFO Gravity Well)

### / (Home)
- Purpose: Reframe the category (yard tool → compounding truckload capacity) and create intrigue.
- Key questions answered:
  - “Is this a tool, or a compounding capacity advantage?”
  - “How does saved time convert into incremental truckloads and profit?”
- Primary CTA: “See the network effect” → /network-effect
- Secondary CTA: “Generate board‑ready ROI” → /roi

### /network-effect (Flagship)
- Purpose: Make the CFO *feel* the compounding advantage and the opportunity cost of staying in pilot.
- Key questions answered:
  - “What compounds as we add facilities?”
  - “Why does rollout beat pilots forever?”
  - “What does 1→5→25→100 change operationally + financially?”
- Primary CTA: “Run your network scenario” → /roi (prefilled)
- Secondary CTA: “Get rollout plan” → /implementation (prefilled)

### /roi
- Purpose: Convert belief into a board‑ready financial story (modeled, transparent assumptions).
- Key questions answered:
  - “How many incremental truckloads are unlocked?”
  - “What is the profit impact (margin vs avoided outsourced capacity)?”
  - “What are hard savings vs opportunity upside?”
  - “What’s realistic Year‑1 realization?”
  - “What’s payback and 5‑year value/NPV?”
- Primary CTA: “Export ROI Summary (PDF)”
- Secondary CTA: “Email to Finance” (server‑side)

### /implementation
- Purpose: Show the rollout ladder is real: timeline, RACI, 30/60/90, change management.
- Key questions answered:
  - “How do we deploy without chaos?”
  - “Who owns what?”
- Primary CTA: “Get rollout plan (PDF)”
- Secondary CTA: “Talk to rollout lead” → /contact (prefilled)

### /pricing
- Purpose: Make buying predictable (how it’s priced, what’s included, how to start).
- Key questions answered:
  - “How does this price across a network?”
  - “What do we buy in pilot vs rollout?”
- Primary CTA: “Request quote / scope” → /contact
- Secondary CTA: “Review security posture” → /security

### /security
- Purpose: De‑risk the yes: controls today + roadmap + procurement artifacts.
- Key questions answered:
  - “Can IT/security sign this?”
  - “What’s the posture now vs roadmap?”
- Primary CTA: “Download security one‑pager (PDF)”
- Secondary CTA: “Loop in IT” share link

### /contact
- Purpose: Convert readiness into motion with persona‑aware form framing.
- Key questions answered:
  - “What happens next?”
  - “Who should join the next call?”
- Primary CTA: “Book rollout call”
- Secondary CTA: “Send procurement packet”

## Persona Ramps (must connect into the CFO spine)

### Ops ramp: /solutions → /product → /implementation → /roi
- /solutions
  - Purpose: Operator moments + outcomes (“what breaks → intervention → measurable outcome”).
  - Primary CTA: “See the product” → /product
  - Secondary CTA: “See rollout plan” → /implementation
- /product
  - Purpose: Make the system feel inevitable (workflows, timestamps, truth).
  - Primary CTA: “Implementation plan” → /implementation
  - Secondary CTA: “Quantify ROI” → /roi

### IT ramp: /security → /integrations → /implementation
- /security
  - Purpose: Posture, controls, roadmap.
  - Primary CTA: “Download security one‑pager (PDF)”
  - Secondary CTA: “See integrations” → /integrations
- /integrations
  - Purpose: Make integration feel bounded: categories, methods, typical timelines.
  - Primary CTA: “Download integration checklist (PDF)”
  - Secondary CTA: “See rollout plan” → /implementation

### Procurement ramp: /pricing → /terms → /privacy → /security
- /pricing
  - Purpose: predictable buying.
  - Primary CTA: “Request quote / scope” → /contact
  - Secondary CTA: “Open terms” → /terms
- /terms
  - Purpose: contract expectations.
  - Primary CTA: “Security posture” → /security
- /privacy
  - Purpose: data handling expectations.
  - Primary CTA: “Security posture” → /security

## Frame Map (Hook → Stakes → Reveal → Proof → CTA)

### / (Home)
- Hook: “Peak season isn’t demand. It’s capacity.”
- Stakes: premium freight + outsourced capacity tax + missed volume.
- Reveal: orchestration removes the constraint and converts time into incremental truckloads.
- Proof: modeled outcomes + artifacts (Evidence Vault).
- CTA: /network-effect then /roi.

### /network-effect
- Hook: “This isn’t a tool. It’s compounding truckload capacity.”
- Stakes: “pilot forever” destroys opportunity cost + rollout speed.
- Reveal: facilities → network multiplier (modeled curve).
- Proof: transparent assumptions + rollout ladder + anonymized rollout narrative template.
- CTA: scenario → /roi, rollout → /implementation, IT loop-in → /security.

### /roi
- Hook: “Board‑ready ROI story in minutes.”
- Stakes: cost + operational volatility + missed leverage.
- Reveal: capacity unlocked + profit impact + hard savings + network bonus + realistic Year‑1 ramp.
- Proof: assumptions drawer + exportable PDF.
- CTA: export PDF + email to finance.

### /implementation
- Hook: “Rollout without chaos.”
- Stakes: change management failure risks.
- Reveal: pilot → cluster → enterprise standard.
- Proof: RACI + 30/60/90 criteria + templates.
- CTA: export implementation plan PDF.

### /pricing
- Hook: “Buying should be boring.”
- Stakes: procurement friction kills momentum.
- Reveal: network pricing logic + what’s included.
- Proof: links to terms/privacy/security.
- CTA: request quote.

### /security
- Hook: “Make IT comfortable early.”
- Stakes: security review delays kill timelines.
- Reveal: controls now + roadmap.
- Proof: one‑pager PDF + linked artifacts.
- CTA: download PDF + share with IT.
