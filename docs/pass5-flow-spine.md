## Primary CFO Journey (CFO Gravity Well)

### / (Home)
- Purpose: Reframe the category (yard tool → compounding truckload capacity) and create intrigue.
- Questions answered:
  - “Is this a tool, or a compounding capacity advantage?”
  - “How does saved time convert into incremental truckloads and profit?”
- Primary CTA: “See the network effect” → `/network-effect`
- Secondary CTA: “Generate board‑ready ROI” → `/roi`
- Next page handoff: `/network-effect`

### /network-effect (Flagship)
- Purpose: Make the compounding story visceral and formula-defensible.
- Questions answered:
  - “What compounds as we add facilities?”
  - “Is the network effect formula real or marketing?”
- Primary CTA: “Run your network scenario” → `/roi`
- Secondary CTA: “Get rollout plan” → `/implementation`
- Next page handoff: `/roi`

### /roi
- Purpose: Convert belief into a board‑ready financial story (modeled, transparent assumptions).
- Questions answered:
  - “How many incremental truckloads are unlocked?”
  - “What’s the profit impact (margin vs avoided outsourcing)?”
  - “What are hard savings vs modeled upside?”
  - “What’s payback and 5‑year value/NPV?”
- Primary CTA: “Export board‑ready PDF”
- Secondary CTA: “Email to finance”
- Next page handoff: `/implementation` then `/pricing`

### /implementation
- Purpose: Show rollout ladder: timeline, RACI, 30/60/90, change management.
- Primary CTA: “Get rollout plan”
- Secondary CTA: “Talk to rollout lead” → `/contact`
- Next page handoff: `/pricing`

### /pricing
- Purpose: Make buying predictable (what’s included, how to start).
- Primary CTA: “Request quote / scope” → `/contact`
- Secondary CTA: “Review security posture” → `/security`
- Next page handoff: `/security`

### /security
- Purpose: De-risk the yes (controls today + roadmap + artifacts).
- Primary CTA: “Download security one‑pager”
- Secondary CTA: “Loop in IT” share link
- Next page handoff: `/contact`

### /contact
- Purpose: Convert readiness into motion (persona-aware form framing).
- Primary CTA: “Book rollout call”
- Secondary CTA: “Send procurement packet”

## Persona ramps (connect back into the spine)

### Ops: `/solutions → /product → /implementation → /roi`
- `/solutions` primary: `/product` secondary: `/implementation`
- `/product` primary: `/implementation` secondary: `/roi`

### IT/Sec: `/security → /integrations → /implementation`
- `/security` primary: security artifact secondary: `/integrations`
- `/integrations` primary: integration checklist secondary: `/implementation`

### Procurement: `/pricing → /terms → /privacy → /security`
- `/pricing` secondary: `/terms`
- `/terms` next: `/privacy` → `/security`

## Frame map (Hook → Stakes → Reveal → Proof → CTA)

### Home
- Hook: “Peak season isn’t demand. It’s capacity.”
- Stakes: outsourced capacity tax + missed volume.
- Reveal: orchestration converts minutes into incremental truckloads.
- Proof: modeled outputs + downloadable artifacts.
- CTA: `/network-effect` then `/roi`.

### Network effect
- Hook: “This isn’t a tool. It’s compounding truckload capacity.”
- Stakes: ‘pilot forever’ kills opportunity cost.
- Reveal: facilities → multiplier (Metcalfe-inspired, realization-adjusted).
- Proof: show-the-math + rollout ladder + proof links.
- CTA: `/roi`, `/implementation`, `/security`.

### ROI
- Hook: “Board-ready ROI story in minutes.”
- Stakes: volatility + peak season penalty.
- Reveal: capacity unlocked + profit impact + hard savings + network bonus.
- Proof: assumptions + exports.
- CTA: export + email.
