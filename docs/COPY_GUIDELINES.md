## Brand Voice Definition

### Core Principles

**YardFlow speaks to operations leaders with clarity and data. No hype.**

We show how standardization beats chaos. Every sentence should move toward "Book an audit" or "Run ROI."

**Tone Attributes:**
- **Data-driven:** Metrics, not marketing fluff
- **Action-oriented:** What you can do, not what we hope
- **Operational:** Speaks to yard managers, logistics VPs, operations directors
- **Confident:** We've solved this; we'll show you how
- **No BS:** Transparent about costs, timelines, results

## Terminology Standards

### Preferred Terms

| Concept | Use This | Avoid This | Rationale |
|---------|----------|------------|-----------|
| **Problem** | Variance | Chaos, inefficiency, waste | Measurable, technical |
| **Solution** | Standardized flow | Efficiency, optimization, improvement | Action-oriented |
| **Network Effect** | Network compounding | Network effect, viral growth | Brand-specific, measurable |
| **Protocol** | Standardized protocol | Standard process, best practice | Emphasizes repeatability |
| **Location** | Yard, facility | Site, warehouse, location | Industry-specific |
| **Digital Twin** | Digital twin | Virtual model, simulation | Industry standard term |
| **Orchestration** | Yard orchestration | Coordination, management | Product capability |
| **Security** | Yard security | Surveillance, monitoring | Product capability |

### Voice Examples

**✅ Good (Data-Driven, Operational):**
> "Primo reduced variance by 63% in Year 1. Their yard ops teams now process 40% more trucks per day with zero guard staff increase."

**❌ Bad (Vague, Salesy):**
> "Primo saw amazing results with YardFlow. Their efficiency skyrocketed and operations teams loved it!"

---

**✅ Good (Action-Oriented):**
> "Run your ROI in 3 minutes. See exact Year 1 savings and compounding network value."

**❌ Bad (Passive):**
> "You can calculate your ROI if you want. It might help you understand the value."

---

**✅ Good (Confident, Specific):**
> "We deploy in 90 days: 30-day digital twin, 60-day protocol rollout, go-live at Day 90."

**❌ Bad (Hedging, Vague):**
> "We usually try to deploy pretty quickly, depending on your specific situation and requirements."

## Page-Specific Copy Standards

### Home Page Hero

**Formula:**
1. **Hook:** Problem statement (variance costs you $X)
2. **Solution:** Standardized flow eliminates variance
3. **Proof:** Primo 63% reduction (1 sentence)
4. **CTA:** "Book a Network Audit" + "Run ROI"

**Example:**
> **Variance costs you $8.4M per year.**  
> Standardized flow eliminates variance. Primo reduced variance by 63% in Year 1.  
> [Book a Network Audit] [Run ROI Calculator]

---

### ROI Page Intro

**Formula:**
1. **What:** ROI calculator shows Year 1-3 savings
2. **How:** Enter facility count, see network compounding
3. **Proof:** Based on Primo data (Year 1 Deep Model)
4. **CTA:** "Run calculation below"

**Example:**
> Calculate your yard's ROI in 3 minutes. Enter facility count. See Year 1-3 savings + network compounding. Based on Primo's Year 1 Deep Model (validated proof).

---

### Diagnostic Page Intro

**Formula:**
1. **What:** Diagnostic identifies variance sources
2. **How:** Answer 5 questions, get variance score
3. **Result:** Specific recommendations + ROI link
4. **CTA:** "Start diagnostic"

**Example:**
> Identify your yard's variance sources in 2 minutes. Answer 5 questions. Get variance score + specific recommendations. [Start Diagnostic]

---

### Product Page (Yard Orchestration)

**Formula:**
1. **Problem:** Variance (driver wait times, gate delays, congestion)
2. **Solution:** Digital Guard + Orchestration Engine
3. **Outcome:** 40% throughput increase, zero guard staff added
4. **Proof:** Primo case study (1 sentence)
5. **CTA:** "Schedule audit" + "Run diagnostic"

**Example:**
> **Variance slows throughput by 40%.**  
> Digital Guard + Orchestration Engine eliminate driver wait times. Primo increased throughput 40% with zero guard staff increase.  
> [Schedule Audit] [Run Diagnostic]

## Copy Audit Checklist

### Hero Sections (Above Fold)

**Check for:**
- [ ] Problem stated clearly (variance, costs, pain)
- [ ] Solution stated in 1 sentence (standardized flow, protocol)
- [ ] Proof cited (Primo, network compounding, metrics)
- [ ] CTA specific (not vague "Learn More")

**Example Violations:**
- ❌ "Welcome to YardFlow" (no value prop)
- ❌ "We make yards better" (vague)
- ❌ "Click here to learn more" (non-specific CTA)

---

### Copy Length (Sentence/Paragraph Guidelines)

**Sentences:**
- **Max length:** 25 words (ideal: 15-20 words)
- **Reason:** Operations leaders scan; long sentences lose attention

**Paragraphs:**
- **Max length:** 3 sentences (ideal: 2 sentences)
- **Reason:** White space improves scannability

**Example:**
✅ **Good (2 sentences, 30 words total):**
> Variance costs you $8.4M per year. Standardized flow eliminates variance in 90 days.

❌ **Bad (1 sentence, 45 words):**
> Variance in yard operations can cost logistics facilities millions of dollars annually, but with YardFlow's standardized flow protocol, you can eliminate variance and see results within just 90 days of deployment.

---

### Active Voice vs. Passive Voice

**Use active voice:**
- ✅ "Primo reduced variance by 63%"
- ❌ "Variance was reduced by 63% at Primo"

**Use imperative (commands) for CTAs:**
- ✅ "Book an audit"
- ❌ "You can book an audit"

---

## Messaging Hierarchy (Primary → Supporting)

### Primary Message (Every Page)
**"Standardized flow eliminates variance."**

Use this exact phrase (or close variant) on:
- Home hero
- Product pages
- ROI intro
- Diagnostic intro
- Footer tagline

---

### Supporting Messages (Context-Dependent)

| Page | Supporting Message |
|------|-------------------|
| **Home** | "Primo reduced variance by 63% in Year 1" |
| **ROI** | "Network compounding drives 3-year value" |
| **Diagnostic** | "Identify variance sources in 2 minutes" |
| **Product** | "Digital Guard + Orchestration Engine = 40% throughput" |
| **Co-Dev** | "Join 3 operators building the network" |

---

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid These)

### ❌ Hype Language
**Bad:**
> "Revolutionary AI-powered yard management transforms logistics forever!"

**Why:** Overpromises; not data-driven; sounds like marketing fluff.

**Fix:**
> "Digital twin identifies 63% of variance sources in 30 days."

---

### ❌ Vague CTAs
**Bad:**
> "Learn more about our solutions"

**Why:** User doesn't know what "more" means or where link goes.

**Fix:**
> "Run ROI Calculator" (specific, actionable)

---

### ❌ Feature Dumps
**Bad:**
> "YardFlow includes: real-time visibility, predictive analytics, AI-powered scheduling, mobile driver app, guard automation, asset tracking, and more!"

**Why:** Overwhelming; no hierarchy; sounds like a spec sheet.

**Fix:**
> "Digital Guard eliminates driver wait times. Orchestration Engine increases throughput 40%." (outcome-focused)

---

### ❌ Passive Construction
**Bad:**
> "Results can be seen within 90 days of deployment."

**Why:** Weak; avoids responsibility; sounds uncertain.

**Fix:**
> "You'll see results in 90 days." (active, confident)

---

## Copy Testing Framework

### A/B Test Priorities (Post-Launch)

1. **Hero CTA label:**
   - A: "Book a Network Audit"
   - B: "Schedule Audit Call"
   - Metric: Click-through rate

2. **ROI page intro:**
   - A: "Calculate your yard's ROI in 3 minutes"
   - B: "See Year 1-3 savings in 3 minutes"
   - Metric: Completion rate

3. **Diagnostic CTA:**
   - A: "Start Diagnostic"
   - B: "Find Your Variance Score"
   - Metric: Diagnostic starts

---

## Consistency Checks (Manual Audit)

### Key Pages to Review

- [ ] Home page hero + sections
- [ ] ROI intro + result copy
- [ ] Diagnostic intro + questions
- [ ] Product pages (Orchestration, Security, YardBuilder)
- [ ] Solution pages (Dry Van, Retail, 3PL, Port, LTL)
- [ ] About page (company narrative)
- [ ] Contact page (form + CTAs)
- [ ] Footer (tagline + links)

### Audit Questions

For each page:
1. **Problem clear?** Does user understand variance/pain?
2. **Solution specific?** Not vague "we help" language?
3. **Proof cited?** Primo, metrics, network compounding?
4. **CTA actionable?** Specific next step (not generic "Learn More")?
5. **Tone consistent?** Data-driven, operational, no hype?
