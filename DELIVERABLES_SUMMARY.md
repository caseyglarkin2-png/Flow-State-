## What Was Actually Built (Existing Infrastructure)

✅ **Variance Tax Protocol infrastructure** (complete, validated):
- 6-component cost model (Recovery, Detention, Labor, Chargeback, Working Capital, Lost Sales)
- Zustand store with calculator logic
- Golden tests with snapshots (4 presets)
- TypeScript types with JSDoc sources

✅ **WebGL visualization infrastructure** (complete, polished):
- BlackHole shader (raymarching, gravitational lensing)
- ParticleNetwork component (instanced mesh, 5000+ particles)
- DissolveTransition (noise-based morphing)
- SingularityScene orchestrator (quality tiers, perf monitoring, accessibility)
- Audio integration framework

✅ **UI components** (complete, responsive):
- CalculatorPanel (12 inputs, real-time updates)
- TaxBreakdown (6-component cost visualization)
- VarianceTaxDashboard (split/stacked/overlay layouts)
- SingularityVisualizer (shader binding, live metrics)

✅ **Current site structure**:
- Homepage (needs narrative update)
- /roi page (needs positioning link to Variance Tax)
- /singularity page (now integrated with new dashboard)
- /diagnostic page (already exists, works)

- [ ] Mobile responsive calculator
- [ ] Audio integration

### Sprint 3: Integration & Launch (3 weeks)
- [ ] Homepage scrollytelling journey
- [ ] /singularity full end-to-end experience

## Critical Decisions (Needed This Week)

### Decision 1: Repurpose or Rebuild?
**Recommendation:** Repurpose existing ROI/Singularity pages.  
**Owner:** CEO  
**Impact:** Strategy, timeline, scope

### Decision 2: Shader Spike?
**Recommendation:** Approve 3-day spike to de-risk.  
**Owner:** CTO  
**Impact:** Risk mitigation, confidence

### Decision 3: Copy Approval Process?
**Recommendation:** CEO owns final approval, 2-day turnaround.  
**Owner:** CEO  
**Impact:** Speed, quality, brand coherence

### Decision 4: Launch Date?
**Recommendation:** April 15, 2026 (12 weeks).  
**Owner:** CEO + Board  
**Impact:** Timeline, resource planning, market readiness

### Decision 5: Content Management?
**Recommendation:** Markdown + Git (not CMS).  
**Owner:** Head of Product  
**Impact:** Workflow, version control, audit trail

## The Promise of This Plan

If executed as documented:

✅ **You will launch a stunning, cohesive "Singularity Event" experience** that positions YardFlow as the first Yard Network System.

✅ **All economic logic remains unchanged** (formulas, ROI calc, Variance Tax model intact).

✅ **The site will be repurposed, not rebuilt** (fast, low-risk, maximizes existing work).

✅ **Quality gates are enforced** (no regressions, performance budgets respected, accessibility audit mandatory).

✅ **Every task is atomic and testable** (clear pass/fail criteria, easy to track, hard to slip).

✅ **The team knows exactly what to build** (no ambiguity, no scope creep, no roadmap drift).

✅ **You can ship in April with confidence** (and if blockers arise, you know exactly how to escalate).

2. **Assemble the team** (CTO assigns Agent roles)
3. **Share QUICK_REFERENCE.md** with everyone (immediate, keep it visible)
4. **Start Sprint 0 on Feb 1** (if shader spike approved)
5. **Kick off Sprint 1 on Feb 8** (kick-off meeting Fri, Jan 31)
6. **Demo every 4 weeks** (internal, then stakeholder UAT)
7. **Ship to production Apr 15** (confidence high, risks mitigated)

## Questions to Ask Yourself

- ✅ Does the 3-sprint plan make sense for your team?
- ✅ Are the 5 decisions decisions you need to make (vs. delegate)?
- ✅ Is April 15 a realistic launch date (or do you need May 1)?
- ✅ Do you have the 5 agents (or do you need to hire)?
- ✅ Are the quality gates appropriate for a launch of this magnitude?

If you answered YES to all 5, **you're ready to execute.**

---

## One Final Note

This plan is detailed, rigorous, and thorough because **YardFlow deserves a rigorous launch.** You're not shipping a "yard app"—you're introducing the first "Yard Network System," a new category that will reshape how supply chain leaders think about operational predictability.

The infrastructure is built. The quality bars are set. The team knows what to do.

**What's left is execution. And this plan makes that execution bulletproof.**
