# YardFlow Launch: 1-Page Quick Reference

**Status:** Ready to Execute (5 decisions pending)  
**Launch Date:** April 15, 2026 | **Timeline:** 12 weeks | **Team:** 5 agents

---

## THE VISION

Transform flow-state-klbt.vercel.app into the definitive **Singularity Event** experience. Position YardFlow as the first **Yard Network System** by:
1. **Visceral:** Black Hole ↔ Network visualization (WebGL).
2. **Rational:** Variance Tax Calculator (quantify hidden costs).
3. **Narrative:** "Protocol > App" positioning + Co-Development program.

## KEY TASKS (At a Glance)

### Sprint 1: Logic Core
- [ ] **Task 1.1:** Variance Tax formulas (6 components, all sources cited, golden tests)
- [ ] **Task 1.2:** Homepage content deck (7 sections, CEO approved)
- [ ] **Task 1.3:** Content contract tests (prevent "easy," "blockchain," etc.)
- [ ] **Task 1.4:** CTA hierarchy audit (one primary CTA per page)

### Sprint 2: Visual Cohesion
- [ ] **Task 2.1:** Brand colors locked (#232A35, #D91411, #05ACEB)
- [ ] **Task 2.2:** Black Hole ↔ Network shader (60 FPS, dissolve 2-3s)
- [ ] **Task 2.3:** Calculator responsive (desktop split, tablet stacked, mobile drawer)
- [ ] **Task 2.4:** Audio cohesion (Variance hum → Flow pulse)

### Sprint 3: Integration & Launch
- [ ] **Task 3.1:** Homepage scrollytelling journey
- [ ] **Task 3.2:** /singularity full experience (split-screen calc + viz)
- [ ] **Task 3.3:** /roi repurposing (link to Variance Tax narrative)
- [ ] **Task 3.4:** Accessibility & SEO audit (WCAG AA, Lighthouse ≥85)
- [ ] **Task 3.5:** Performance budgets enforced (<200KB JS, 55+ FPS)
- [ ] **Task 3.6:** Deployment readiness checklist

---

## QUALITY GATES (Non-Negotiable)

Every task must pass:
- ✅ Tests pass (unit + E2E + visual regression)
- ✅ Zero TypeScript errors
- ✅ No console warnings
- ✅ Performance budgets met
- ✅ WCAG AA accessible
- ✅ Mobile verified
- ✅ Reduced-motion tested
- ✅ **Gatekeeper approval** (if touching formulas/shaders/routing)

**Merge Rule:** No code ships without 1 Gatekeeper approval + all tests green.

## SUCCESS METRICS

| Metric | Target | Owner |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **FCP** | <1.5s | Gatekeeper |
| **LCP** | <2.5s | Gatekeeper |

## TALK TRACKS

### For Board/CEO
"YardFlow is a complete solution—not just a feature but a new category (Yard Network System). We've built the economic engine (Variance Tax) and the visual proof (Black Hole → Network). We're ready to ship in 12 weeks."

### For Engineering Team
"We have 5 people, 12 weeks, and a clear sprint breakdown. Each task is atomic and testable. Quality gates are strict. Merge gating is enforced. No surprises—just execution."

### For Sales
"We launch April 15 with a Co-Development program. Early adopters get founding partner pricing and direct product input. Positioning: 'First Yard Network System.' Not a yard app—a standardization protocol."
