## REVIEW METHODOLOGY

This review followed a structured architecture assessment:

1. **Completeness Validation** ✅
   - Does plan cover all critical work?
   - Are dependencies properly mapped?
   - Is the narrative coherent?

2. **Gap Identification** ✅
   - What's missing? (scope, dependencies, risk)
   - What's unclear? (vague acceptance criteria)
   - What's underestimated? (effort, timeline)

3. **Feasibility Assessment** ✅
   - Is 3-sprint timeline realistic? (No → 4 sprints needed)
   - Are tasks atomic and committable? (Mostly, some too large)
   - Are quality gates appropriate? (Yes, but execution varies)

4. **Risk Inventory** ✅
   - What could derail execution? (Shader spike, model decision, scope creep)
   - What's the mitigation? (Spike, decision gate, freeze)
   - What's the contingency? (Fallback plans defined)

5. **Narrative Alignment** ✅
   - Does plan deliver on whitepaper thesis? (Yes)
   - Is customer journey coherent? (Mostly, /roi adds confusion)
   - Are claims traceable? (Intent good, execution varies)

## SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

### WHAT'S WORKING ✅
1. **Strategic Thesis:** Whitepaper alignment solid, narrative coherent
2. **Economic Model:** 6 components well-defined, formulas specific, sourcing clear
3. **Quality Gates:** Definition of Done comprehensive, performance budgets defined
4. **Visual Vision:** Black Hole → Network metaphor powerful and emotionally resonant
5. **Team Structure:** Agent roles clear (Economist, Visualist, Architect, Gatekeeper, Closer)

### WHAT NEEDS FIXING ⚠️
1. **Timeline Realism:** 10 weeks stated → 14-15 weeks needed (+4-5 weeks)
2. **Scope Ambiguity:** Tasks 2.2-2.4 (visual polish) lack quantifiable acceptance criteria
3. **Critical Blockers:** 4 P0 items unresolved (model, spike approval, content, rollback)
4. **Execution Clarity:** 40% of plan is detailed, 60% is vague (esp. Sprints 2-3)
5. **Risk Management:** No risk register, no weekly review process, no escalation path

### WHAT'S MISSING ❌
1. **Pre-Sprint 0:** No decision gate for 5 critical blockers
2. **Task 1.2.5:** CEO copy review gate (new task, 12 hours)
3. **Task 1.99:** Shader spike (new task, 48 hours, critical de-risking)
4. **Task 3.1 Breakdown:** Homepage should be 5 subtasks, not 1 giant task (80h, not 20h)
5. **Risk Register:** No weekly tracking, no escalation, no contingencies documented
